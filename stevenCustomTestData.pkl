S'  Many computer vision problems (e.g., camera calibration, image alignment,\nstructure from motion) are solved with nonlinear optimization methods. It is\ngenerally accepted that second order descent methods are the most robust, fast,\nand reliable approaches for nonlinear optimization of a general smooth\nfunction. However, in the context of computer vision, second order descent\nmethods have two main drawbacks: (1) the function might not be analytically\ndifferentiable and numerical approximations are impractical, and (2) the\nHessian may be large and not positive definite. To address these issues, this\npaper proposes generic descent maps, which are average "descent directions" and\nrescaling factors learned in a supervised fashion. Using generic descent maps,\nwe derive a practical algorithm - Supervised Descent Method (SDM) - for\nminimizing Nonlinear Least Squares (NLS) problems. During training, SDM learns\na sequence of decent maps that minimize the NLS. In testing, SDM minimizes the\nNLS objective using the learned descent maps without computing the Jacobian or\nthe Hessian. We prove the conditions under which the SDM is guaranteed to\nconverge. We illustrate the effectiveness and accuracy of SDM in three computer\nvision problems: rigid image alignment, non-rigid image alignment, and 3D pose\nestimation. In particular, we show how SDM achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance in the problem of facial feature detection. The code has been made\navailable at www.humansensing.cs.cmu.edu/intraface.\n'

S'  Biological information is not only stored in the digital chemical sequence of\ndouble helical DNA, but is also encoded in the mechanical properties of the DNA\nstrands, which can influence biochemical processes involving its readout. For\nexample, loop formation in the Lac operon can regulate the expression of key\ngenes, and DNA supercoiling is closely correlated to rhythmic circardian gene\nexpression in cyanobacteria. Supercoiling is also important for large scale\norganisation of the genome in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells. DNA can\nrespond to torsional stress by writhing to form looped structures called\nplectonemes, thus transferring energy stored as twist into energy stored in\nbending. Denaturation bubbles can also relax torsional stress, with the\nenthalpic cost of breaking bonds being compensated by their ability to absorb\nundertwist. Here we predict a novel regime where bubbles form at the tips of\nplectonemes, and study its properties using coarse-grained simulations. These\ntip bubbles can occur for both positive and negative supercoiling and greatly\nreduce plectoneme diffusion by a pinning mechanism. They can cause plectonemes\nto preferentially localise to AT rich regions, because bubbles more easily form\nthere. The tip-bubble regime occurs for supercoiling densities and forces that\nare typically encountered for DNA in vivo, and may be exploited for biological\ncontrol of genomic processes.\n'

S"  In this paper we present a theory that predicts the phase noise\ncharacteristics of self-sustained optomechanical oscillators. By treating the\ncavity optomechanical system as a feedback loop consisting of an optical cavity\nand a mechanical resonator, we analytically derive the transfer functions\nrelating the amplitude/phase noise of all the relevant dynamical quantities\nfrom the quantum Langevin equations, and obtain a closed-form expressions for\nthe phase noise spectral densities contributed from thermomechanical noise,\nphoton shot noise, and low-frequency technical laser noise. We numerically\ncalculate the phase noise for various situations and perform a sample\ncalculation for an experimentally demonstrated system. We also show that the\npresented model reduces to the well-known Leeson's phase noise model when the\namplitude noise and the amplitude/phase noise inter-transfers are ignored.\n"

The optical\nabsorption spectra of multilayers black phosphorus are shown to vary\nsensitively with thickness, doping, and light polarization. In conjunction with\nexperimental spectra obtained from infrared absorption spectroscopy, we discuss\nthe role of interband coupling and disorder on the observed anisotropic\nabsorption spectra. Multilayers black phosphorus might offer attractive\nalternatives to narrow gap compound semiconductors for optoelectronics across\nmid- to near-infrared frequencies.\n'

Therein the polynomial order $p$ will be usually greater then two,\ni.e. we will consider higher-order methods. Most of the analysis presented here\nis done in the standard energy norm.\n  Nevertheless, the question arises: Is this the right norm for this kind of\nproblem, especially if characteristic layers occur? We will address this\nquestion by looking into a balanced norm.\n  Finally, a-posteriori error analysis is an important tool to construct\nadapted meshes iteratively by solving discrete problems, estimating the error\nand adjusting the mesh accordingly.

S'  Physical understanding of the links between soil swelling, texture,\nstructure, cracking, and sample size is of great interest for the physical\nunderstanding of many processes in the soil-air-water system and for\napplications in civil, agricultural, and environmental engineering. The\nbackground of this work is an available chain of interconnected physical\nshrinkage curve models for clay, intra-aggregate matrix, aggregated soil\nwithout cracks, and soil with cracks. The objective of the work is to\ngeneralize these models to the case of swelling, and to construct the\nphysical-swelling-model chain with a step-by-step transition from clay to\naggregated soil with cracks. The generalization is based on thorough accounting\nfor the analogies and differences between shrinkage and swelling and the\ncorresponding use, modification, or replacement of the soil shrinkage features.\nTwo specific soil swelling features to be used are: (i) air entrapping in pores\nof the contributing clay; and (ii) aggregate destruction with the formation of\nnew aggregate surfaces. The input for the prediction of the swelling curve of\nan aggregated soil coincides with that of the available model of the shrinkage\ncurve. The analysis of available data on the maximum shrink-swell cycle of two\nsoils with different texture and structure, accounting for sample size is\nconducted as applied to swelling curves and to the residual crack volume and\nmaximum-swelling-volume decrease after the shrink-swell cycle. Results of the\nanalysis show evidence in favor of the swelling model chain.\n'

S'  Nanomagnetic Boolean logic paradigms [1,2],implemented with nanomagnets\nencoding binary bits in their bistable magnetization orientations, have\nattracted immense attention because of their non-volatility and the promise of\nunprecedented energy-efficiency. Unfortunately, the energy-efficiency has\nremained elusive because of the large dissipative losses that take place when\nnanomagnets are switched with a magnetic field [3], or spin-transfer-torque\n[4]. Recently, there have been experimental reports of utilizing the Spin Hall\neffect for switching magnets [5,6],as well as theoretical proposals for\nemploying strain to switch single-domain magnetostrictive nanomagnets [7-13],\nthat might reduce the dissipative losses significantly. However, experimental\nwork in strain-induced switching has been limited to magnets that are\nmulti-domain [14] or magnets where strain moves domain walls [15-17]. Here, we\ndemonstrate, for the first time, strain-induced switching of single-domain\nmagnetostrictive nanomagnets of lateral dimensions ~200 nm fabricated on a\npiezoelectric substrate. We also demonstrate a nanomagnetic Boolean NOT gate\nand unidirectional bit information propagation through a finite chain of\ndipole-coupled nanomagnets by "clocking" them with strain. This portends\nultra-low-energy logic processors and mobile electronics that may be able to\noperate solely by harvesting energy from the environment without ever requiring\na battery.\n'

S'  In this work, we combine a systematic experimental investigation of the\npower- and temperature-dependent evolution of the spatial coherence function,\n$g^{(1)}(r)$, in a one-dimensional exciton-polariton channel with a modern\nmicroscopic numerical theory based on a stochastic master equation approach.\nThe spatial coherence function $g^{(1)}(r)$ is extracted via the high-precision\nMichelson interferometry, which allows us to demonstrate that in the regime of\nnon-resonant excitation, the dependence $g^{(1)}(r)$ reaches a saturation value\nwith a plateau, determined by the intensity of pump and effective temperature\nof the crystal lattice. The theory, which for the first time allows treating\nincoherent excitation in a stochastic frame, matches the experimental data with\nexcellent qualitative and quantitative agreement. This allows us to verify the\nprediction that the decay of off diagonal long range order can be almost fully\nsuppressed in one-dimensional condensate systems.\n'

S'  Spin transfer torque affords magnetic nanodevices the potential to act as\nmemory, computing, and microwave elements operating at ultra-low currents and\nat a low energy cost. Spin transfer torque is not only effective in\nmanipulating well-known magnetic structures, such as domain walls and vortices,\nbut can also nucleate previously unattainable nano-magnetic objects, such as\nmagnetic droplets and skyrmions. While the droplet and the skyrmion are both\nsolitons, the former is inherently dynamic and non-topological, whereas the\nlatter is static but topologically protected. Here we show that it is possible\nto combine these properties into a novel dynamic and topologically protected\nmagnetic soliton, a so-called \\textit{droplet skyrmion}, which adds additional\ndegrees of freedom, and functionality, to both droplet and skyrmion based\napplications. We present the conditions required for the topological\ntransformation of a droplet into a droplet skyrmion and furthermore how field\nand current can be used to reversibly tune the magnetic state between a\ndroplet, a droplet skyrmion, a static skyrmion, and a uniform ferromagnetic\nstate.\n'

S'  Backward error initialization and parasitic mode control are well-suited for\nuse in algorithms that arise from a discrete variational principle on\nphase-space dynamics. Dynamical systems described by degenerate Lagrangians,\nsuch as those occurring in phase-space action principles, lead to variational\nmultistep algorithms for the integration of first-order differential equations.\nAs multistep algorithms, an initialization procedure must be chosen and the\nstability of parasitic modes assessed. The conventional selection of initial\nconditions using accurate one-step methods does not yield the best numerical\nperformance for smoothness and stability. Instead, backward error\ninitialization identifies a set of initial conditions that minimize the\namplitude of undesirable parasitic modes. This issue is especially important in\nthe context of structure-preserving multistep algorithms where numerical\ndamping of the parasitic modes would violate the conservation properties. In\nthe presence of growing parasitic modes, the algorithm may also be periodically\nre-initialized to prevent the undesired mode from reaching large amplitude.\nNumerical examples of variational multistep algorithms are presented in which\nthe backward error initialized trajectories outperform those initialized using\nhighly accurate approximations of the true solution.\n'

The goal is to estimate the mean\n\\vectheta at the optimal minimax rate while communicating as few bits as\npossible. We show that in this simple setting, the communication cost scales\nlinearly in the number of dimensions i.e. one needs to deal with different\ndimensions individually.\n'

S'  Interactions between Fermi liquid quasiparticle and gapless bosons, such as\nphotons or quantum critical fluctuations, are expected to destabilize the Fermi\nliquid and lead to overdamping of the bosonic modes. However, coupling\nelectrons to Nambu-Goldstone bosons (NGBs), typically does not have such a\ndramatic effect. This arises because symmetry usually dictates the existence of\nderivatives in the coupling, which makes them vanish in the limit of small\nenergy-momentum transfer. Here we formulate a general criterion which specifies\nwhen this coupling can be free of derivatives, which makes it similar to the\ncoupling to gauge fields or quantum critical modes. This criterion is satisfied\nby the example of the nematic Fermi fluid that spontaneously breaks rotation\nsymmetry while preserving translations, where non-Fermi liquid physics and\noverdamping of NGBs was discussed by Oganesyan-Kivelson-Fradkin. In addition,\nthe criterion also allows us to identify a new kind of symmetry breaking - of\nmagnetic translations - where non vanishing couplings are expected, which is\nconfirmed by an explicit calculation.\n'

S'  We study the density-density correlation function $G({\\bf r},{\\bf r}\')$ in\nthe interfacial region of a fluid (or Ising-like magnet) with short-ranged\ninteractions using square gradient density functional theory. Adopting a simple\ndouble parabola approximation for the bulk free-energy density, we first show\nthat the parallel Fourier transform $G(z,z\';q)$ and local structure factor\n$S(z;q)$ separate into bulk and excess contributions. We attempt to account for\nboth contributions by deriving an interfacial Hamiltonian, characterised by a\nwavevector dependent surface tension $\\sigma(q)$, and then reconstructing\ndensity correlations from correlations in the interface position. We show that\nthe standard crossing criterion identification of the interface, as a surface\nof fixed density (or magnetization), does not explain the separation of\n$G(z,z\';q)$ and the form of the excess contribution. We propose an alternative\ndefinition of the interface position based on the properties of correlations\nbetween points that "float" with the surface and show that this describes the\nfull $q$ and $z$ dependence of the excess contributions to both $G$ and $S$.\nHowever, neither the "crossing-criterion" nor the new "floating interface"\ndefinition of $\\sigma(q)$ are quantities directly measurable from the total\nstructure factor $S^{tot}(q)$ which contains additional $q$ dependence arising\nfrom the non-local relation between fluctuations in the interfacial position\nand local density. Since it is the total structure factor that is measured\nexperimentally or in simulations, our results have repercussions for earlier\nattempts to extract and interpret $\\sigma(q)$.\n'

S'  Many-body correlations can yield key insights into the nature of interacting\nsystems; however, detecting them is often very challenging in many-particle\nphysics, especially in nanoscale systems. Here, taking a phosphorus donor\nelectron spin in a natural-abundance 29Si nuclear spin bath as our model\nsystem, we discover both theoretically and experimentally that many-body\ncorrelations in nanoscale nuclear spin baths produce identifiable signatures in\nthe decoherence of the central spin under multiple-pulse dynamical decoupling\ncontrol. We find that when the number of decoupling -pulses is odd, central\nspin decoherence is primarily driven by second-order nuclear spin correlations\n(pairwise flip-flop processes). In contrast, when the number of -pulses is\neven, fourth-order nuclear spin correlations (diagonal interaction renormalized\npairwise flip-flop processes) are principally responsible for the central spin\ndecoherence. Many-body correlations of different orders can thus be selectively\ndetected by central spin decoherence under different dynamical decoupling\ncontrols, providing a useful approach to probing many-body processes in\nnanoscale nuclear spin baths.\n'

More specifically, we are using a random forest classifier to classify\npixels into joint-based body part categories, much similar to the famous Kinect\npose estimator [11], [12]. However, we are using pure RGB input, i.e. no depth.\nSince the random forest requires a large number of training examples, we are\nusing computer graphics generated, synthetic training data. In addition, we\nassume that we have access to a large number of real images with bounding box\nlabels, extracted for example by a pedestrian detector or a tracking system. We\npropose a new objective function for random forest training that uses the\nweakly labeled data from the target domain to encourage the learner to select\nfeatures that generalize from the synthetic source domain to the real target\ndomain. We demonstrate on a publicly available dataset [6] that the proposed\nobjective function yields a classifier that significantly outperforms a\nbaseline classifier trained using the standard entropy objective [10].\n'

S'  Quantum field theories (QFTs) are among the deepest descriptions of nature.\nIn this sense, different computing approaches have been developed, as Feynman\ndiagrams or lattice gauge theories. In general, the numerical simulations of\nQFTs are computationally hard, with the processing time growing exponentially\nwith the system size. Nevertheless, a quantum simulator could provide an\nefficient way to emulate these theories in polynomial time. Here, we propose\nthe quantum simulation of fermionic field modes interacting via a continuum of\nbosonic modes with superconducting circuits, which are among the most advanced\nquantum technologies in terms of quantum control and scalability. An important\nfeature of superconducting devices is that, unlike other quantum platforms,\nthey offer naturally a strong coupling of qubits to a continuum of bosonic\nmodes. Therefore, this system is a specially suited platform to realize quantum\nsimulations of scattering processes involving interacting fermionic and bosonic\nquantum field theories, where access to the continuum of modes is required.\n'

S'  Using first-principles calculations, we investigated the impact of chromium\n(Cr) and vanadium (V) impurities on the magnetic anisotropy and spin\npolarization in Fe/MgO magnetic tunnel junctions. It is demonstrated using\nlayer resolved anisotropy calculation technique, that while the impurity near\nthe interface has a drastic effect in decreasing the perpendicular magnetic\nanisotropy (PMA), its position within the bulk allows maintaining high surface\nPMA. Moreover, the effective magnetic anisotropy has a strong tendency to go\nfrom in-plane to out-of-plane character as a function of Cr and V concentration\nfavoring out-of-plane magnetization direction for ~1.5 nm thick Fe layers at\nimpurity concentrations above 20 %. At the same time, spin polarization is not\naffected and even enhanced in most situations favoring an increase of tunnel\nmagnetoresistance (TMR) values.\n'

S"  A robust worldwide air-transportation network (WAN) is one that minimizes the\nnumber of stranded passengers under a sequence of airport closures. Here we\naddress how WAN's robustness can profit from local cooperation between\nairports. For this, we reroute a series of flights among airports within a\ncertain distance, a cooperation range, and describe the improvement of WAN's\nrobustness with distance as a continuum transition. We calculate the critical\nexponents and identify a critical cooperation range below which improvement is\nnegligible. We propose a network model that falls into the same universality\nclass in which the probability to connect two nodes decays algebraically with\ntheir distance. Practical implications of this result are also discussed.\n"

It is defined by a complexification of two canonical\ncomplex signals, which can be considered as an inverse operation of the\nCayley-Dickson form of the quaternion. Inspired by the polar form of an\nanalytic signal where the real instantaneous envelope and phase can be\ndetermined, this paper presents a novel method to generate a polar\nrepresentation of the hyperanalytic signal, in which the continuously complex\nenvelope and phase can be uniquely defined. Comparing to other existing\nmethods, the proposed polar representation does not have sign ambiguity between\nthe envelope and the phase, which makes the definition of the instantaneous\ncomplex frequency possible.\n'

S'  A traditional and intuitively appealing Multi-Task Multiple Kernel Learning\n(MT-MKL) method is to optimize the sum (thus, the average) of objective\nfunctions with (partially) shared kernel function, which allows information\nsharing amongst tasks. We point out that the obtained solution corresponds to a\nsingle point on the Pareto Front (PF) of a Multi-Objective Optimization (MOO)\nproblem, which considers the concurrent optimization of all task objectives\ninvolved in the Multi-Task Learning (MTL) problem. Motivated by this last\nobservation and arguing that the former approach is heuristic, we propose a\nnovel Support Vector Machine (SVM) MT-MKL framework, that considers an\nimplicitly-defined set of conic combinations of task objectives. We show that\nsolving our framework produces solutions along a path on the aforementioned PF\nand that it subsumes the optimization of the average of objective functions as\na special case. Using algorithms we derived, we demonstrate through a series of\nexperimental results that the framework is capable of achieving better\nclassification performance, when compared to other similar MTL approaches.\n'

The quantum\ndot is formed by an interface or thickness fluctuation of a GaAs QW embedded in\na AlGaAs shell of a GaAs-AlGaAs core-shell nanowire. As we tune the time at\nwhich carriers are photogenerated during the acoustic cycle, we find pronounced\nintensity oscillations of neutral and negatively charged excitons. At high\nacoustic power levels these oscillations become anticorrelated which enables\ndirect acoustic programming of the dot's charge configuration, emission\nintensity and emission wavelength. Numerical simulations confirm that the\nobserved modulations arise from acoustically controlled modulations of the\nelectron and electron-hole-pair concentrations at the position of the quantum\ndot.\n"

S"  We present a study of the correlated transport regimes of a double quantum\nimpurity system with mutual capacitive interactions. Such system can be\nimplemented by a double quantum dot arrangement or by a quantum dot and nearby\nquantum point contact, with independently connected sets of metallic terminals.\nMany--body spin correlations arising within each dot--lead subsystem give rise\nto the Kondo effect under appropriate conditions. The otherwise independent\nKondo ground states may be modified by the capacitive coupling, decisively\nmodifying the ground state of the double quantum impurity system. We analyze\nthis coupled system through variational methods and the numerical\nrenormalization group technique. Our results reveal a strong dependence of the\ncoupled system ground state on the electron--hole asymmetries of the individual\nsubsystems, as well as on their hybridization strengths to the respective\nreservoirs. The electrostatic repulsion produced by the capacitive coupling\nproduces an effective shift of the individual energy levels toward higher\nenergies, with a stronger effect on the `shallower' subsystem (that closer to\nresonance with the Fermi level), potentially pushing it out of the Kondo regime\nand dramatically changing the transport properties of the system. The effective\nremote gating that this entails is found to depend nonlinearly on the\ncapacitive coupling strength, as well as on the independent subsystem levels.\nThe analysis we present here of this mutual interaction should be important to\nfully characterize transport through such coupled systems.\n"

Since structural inversion asymmetry (SIA) is required\nfor their stability, the observation of chiral domain walls in highly symmetric\nPt/Co/Pt is intriguing. Here, we tune the layer asymmetry in this system and\nobserve, by current-assisted DW depinning experiments, a small chiral field\nwhich sensitively changes. Moreover, we convincingly link the observed\nefficiency of DW motion to the DW texture, using DW resistance as a direct\nprobe for the internal orientation of the DW under the influence of in-plane\nfields. The very delicate effect of capping layer thickness on the chiral field\nallows for its accurate control, which is important in designing novel\nmaterials for optimal spin-orbit-torque-driven DW motion.\n'

S'  While the water molecule is simple, its condensed phase liquid behavior is so\ncomplex that no consensus description has emerged despite three centuries of\neffort. Here we identify features of its behavior that are the most peculiar,\nhence suggest ways forward. We examine the properties of water at the\nboundaries of common experience, including stable states at high pressure, the\nsupercooled state at normal and elevated pressure, and the stretched ("negative\npressure") state, out to the limits of mechanical stability. The familiar\nanomalies at moderate pressures (viscosity and density (TMD) behavior, etc.),\nare not explained by H-bond breaking, according to common bond-breaking\ncriteria. A comparison of data on the TMD, at both positive and negative\npressures, with the predictions of popular pair potential models, shows\ndramatic discrepancies appearing in the stretched liquid domain. This prompts\nquestions on the second critical point (TC2) hypothesis that has been guiding\nmuch current thinking. We turn to related systems for guidance, reviewing a\nhierarchy of water-like anomalies. We conclude that water models are far from\ncomplete and that proper understanding of water will depend on success in\nmastering the measurement of liquid behavior in the negative pressure domain -\nwhich we discuss.\n'

S'  In this work we study the transport properties of non-interacting overdamped\nparticles, moving on tilted disordered potentials, subjected to Gaussian white\nnoise. We give exact formulas for the drift and diffusion coefficients for the\ncase of random potentials resulting from the interaction of a particle with a\n"random polymer". In our model the "random polymer" is made up, by means of\nsome stochastic process, of monomers that can be taken from a finite or\ncountable infinite set of possible monomer types. For the case of uncorrelated\nrandom polymers we found that the diffusion coefficient exhibits a\nnon-monotonous behavior as a function of the noise intensity. Particularly\ninteresting is the fact that the relative diffusivity becomes optimal at a\nfinite temperature, a behavior which is reminiscent to that of stochastic\nresonance. We explain this effect as an interplay between the deterministic and\nnoisy dynamics of the system. We also show that this behavior of the diffusion\ncoefficient at a finite temperature is more pronounced for the case of weakly\ndisordered potentials. We test our findings by means of numerical simulations\nof the corresponding Langevin dynamics of an ensemble of noninteracting\noverdamped particles diffusing on uncorrelated random potentials.\n'

S'  Maximization of the path information entropy is a clear prescription for\nperforming time-dependent plausible inference. Here it is shown that, following\nthis prescription under the assumption of arbitrary instantaneous constraints\non position and velocity, a Lagrangian emerges which determines the most\nprobable trajectory. Deviations from the probability maximum can be\nconsistently described as slices in time by a Hamiltonian, according to a\nnonlinear Langevin equation and its associated Fokker-Planck equation. The\nconnections unveiled between the maximization of path entropy and the\nLangevin/Fokker-Planck equations imply that missing information about the phase\nspace coordinate never decreases in time, a purely information-theoretical\nversion of the Second Law of Thermodynamics. All of these results are\nindependent of any physical assumptions, and thus valid for any generalized\ncoordinate as a function of time, or any other parameter. This reinforces the\nview that the Second Law is a fundamental property of plausible inference.\n'

S'  We present a novel simulation technique derived from Brownian cluster\ndynamics used so far to study the isotropic colloidal aggregation. It now\nimplements the classical Kern-Frenkel potential to describe patchy interactions\nbetween particles. This technique gives access to static properties, dynamics\nand kinetics of the system, even far from the equilibrium. Particle thermal\nmotions are modeled using billions of independent small random translations and\nrotations, constrained by the excluded volume and the connectivity. This\nalgorithm, applied to a single polymer chain leads to correct static and\ndynamic properties, in the framework where hydrodynamic interactions are\nignored. By varying patch angles, various chain flexibilities can be obtained.\nWe have used this new algorithm to model step-growth polymerization under\nvarious solvent qualities. The polymerization reaction is modeled by an\nirreversible aggregation between patches while an isotropic finite square-well\npotential is superimposed to mimic the solvent quality. In bad solvent\nconditions, a competition between a phase separation (due to the isotropic\ninteraction) and polymerization (due to patches) occurs. Surprisingly, an\narrested network with a very peculiar structure appears. It is made of strands\nand nodes. Strands gather few stretched chains that dip into entangled globular\nnodes. These nodes act as reticulation points between the strands. The system\nis kinetically driven and we observe a trapped arrested structure. That\ndemonstrates one of the strengths of this new simulation technique. It can give\nvaluable insights about mechanisms that could be involved in the formation of\nstranded gels.\n'

S'  We revisit the classic thermodynamic problem of maximum work extraction from\ntwo arbitrary sized hot and cold reservoirs, modelled as perfect gases.\nAssuming ignorance about the extent to which the process has advanced, which\nimplies an ignorance about the final temperatures, we quantify the prior\ninformation about the process and assign a prior distribution to the unknown\ntemperature(s). This requires that we also take into account the temperature\nvalues which are regarded to be unphysical in the standard theory, as they lead\nto a contradiction with the physical laws. Instead in our formulation, such\nvalues appear to be consistent with the given prior information and hence are\nincluded in the inference. We derive estimates of the efficiency at optimal\nwork from the expected values of the final temperatures, and show that these\nvalues match with the exact expressions in the limit when any one of the\nreservoirs is very large compared to the other. For other relative sizes of the\nreservoirs, we suggest a weighting procedure over the estimates from two valid\ninference procedures, that generalizes the procedure suggested earlier in [J.\nPhys. A: Math. Theor. {\\bf 46}, 365002 (2013)]. Thus a mean estimate for\nefficiency is obtained which agrees with the optimal performance to a high\naccuracy.\n'

S'  We have investigated the relationship between the morphology of helical\nparticles and the features of the cholesteric (N$^\\ast $) phase that they form.\nUsing an Onsager-like theory, applied to systems of hard helices, we show that\nthe cholesteric handedness and pitch depend on both the pitch and the curliness\nof the particles. The theory leads to the definition of pseudoscalars that\ncorrelate the helical features of the phase to the chirality of the excluded\nvolume of the constituent particles.\n'

S"  We consider the complexity of equivalence and learning for multiplicity tree\nautomata, i.e., weighted tree automata with weights in a field. We first\ncharacterise the complexity of equivalence testing as being logspace equivalent\nto polynomial identity testing. Secondly, we consider the problem of learning\nmultiplicity tree automata in Angluin's exact learning model. Here we give\nlower bounds on the number of queries, both for the case of an arbitrary and a\nfixed underlying field. We also present a learning algorithm in which\ncounterexamples use succinct representations of trees as DAGs. Assuming a\nTeacher that represents counterexamples as succinctly as possible, our\nalgorithm uses exponentially fewer queries than the best previously known\nprocedure, leaving only a polynomial gap with the above-mentioned lower bound.\n"

S'  The moving neutral system of two Coulomb charges on a plane subject to a\nconstant magnetic field $B$ perpendicular to the plane is considered. It is\nshown that the composite system of finite total mass is bound for any\ncenter-of-mass momentum $P$ and magnetic field strength; the energy of the\nground state is calculated accurately using a variational approach. Their\naccuracy is cross-checked in Lagrange-mesh method for $B=1$\\,a.u. and in a\nperturbation theory at small $B$ and $P$. The constructed trial function has a\nproperty to be a uniform approximation of the exact eigenfunction. For Hydrogen\natom and Positronium a double perturbation theory in $B$ and $P$ is developed\nand the first corrections are found algebraically. A phenomenon of a sharp\nchange of energy behavior for a certain center-of-mass momentum but a fixed\nmagnetic field is indicated.\n'

S'  Key frame extraction algorithms consider the problem of selecting a subset of\nthe most informative frames from a video to summarize its content. Several\napplications such as video summarization, search, indexing and prints from\nvideo can benefit from extracted key frames of the video under consideration.\nMost approaches in this class of algorithms work directly with the input video\ndataset, without considering the underlying low rank structure of the dataset.\nOther algorithms exploit the low rank component only; ignoring the other key\ninformation in the video. In this paper, a novel key frame extraction framework\nbased on Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA) is proposed. Furthermore,\nwe target the challenging application of extracting key frames from\nunstructured consumer videos. The proposed framework is motivated by the\nobservation that RPCA decomposes an input data into (a) a low rank component\nthat reveals the systematic information across the elements of the dataset and\n(b) a set of sparse components each of which containing distinct information\nabout each element in the same dataset. The two information types are combined\ninto a single l1-norm based non-convex optimization problem to extract the\ndesired number of key frames. Moreover, we develop a novel iterative algorithm\nto solve this optimization problem. The proposed RPCA-based framework does not\nrequire shot(s) detection, segmentation, or semantic understanding of the\nunderlying video. Finally, experiments are performed on a variety of consumer\nvideos. A comparison of the results obtained by our method with the ground\ntruth and related state-of-the-art algorithms clearly indicates the viability\nof the proposed RPCA-based framework.\n'

S'  Performance accuracy of the Euclidean Distance Discriminant rule (EDDR) is\nstudied in the high-dimensional asymptotic framework which allows the\ndimensionality to exceed sample size. Under mild assumptions on the traces of\nthe covariance matrix, our new results provide the asymptotic distribution of\nthe conditional misclassification error and the explicit expression for the\nconsistent and asymptotically unbiased estimator of the expected\nmisclassification error. To get these properties, new results on the asymptotic\nnormality of the quadratic forms and traces of the higher power of Wishart\nmatrix, are established. Using our asymptotic results, we further develop two\ngeneric methods of determining a cut-off point for EDDR to adjust the\nmisclassification errors. Finally, we numerically justify the high accuracy of\nour asymptotic findings along with the cut-off determination methods in finite\nsample applications, inclusive of the large sample and high-dimensional\nscenarios.\n'

S"  We consider interacting population systems of predator-prey type, presenting\nfour models of control strategies for epidemics among the prey. In particular\nto contain the transmissible disease, safety niches are considered, assuming\nthey lessen the disease spread, but do not protect prey from predators. This\nrepresents a novelty with respect to standard ecosystems where the refuge\nprevents predators' attacks. The niche is assumed either to protect the healthy\nindividuals, or to hinder the infected ones to get in contact with the\nsusceptibles, or finally to reduce altogether contacts that might lead to new\ncases of the infection. In addition a standard culling procedure is also\nanalysed. The effectiveness of the different strategies are compared. Probably\nthe environments providing a place where disease carriers cannot come in\ncontact with the healthy individuals, or where their contact rates are lowered,\nseem to preferable for disease containment.\n"

S'  Injection, transmission, and detection of spins in a conducting channel are\nthe basic ingredients of spintronic devices. Long spin lifetimes during transit\nare an important ingredient in realizing this technology. An attractive\nplatform for this purpose is graphene, which has high mobilities and low\nspin-orbit coupling. Unfortunately, measured spin lifetimes are orders of\nmagnitude smaller than theoretically expected. A source of spin loss is the\nresistance mismatch between the ferromagnetic electrodes and graphene. While\nthis has been studied numerically, here we provide a closed form expression for\nHanle spin precession which is the standard method of measuring spin lifetimes.\nThis allows for a detailed characterization of the nonlocal spin valve device.\n'

In this paper,\nwe showed, unlike the periodic boundary case, both of Neveu-Schwarz (NS) and\nRamond (R) sectors of a superconformal field theory were obtained. Using a\nmethod of nonlinear integral equations for auxiliary functions defined by\neigenvalues of transfer matrices, we found that an excitation state with an odd\nnumber of particles is allowed for a certain value of a boundary parameter even\non a system consisting of an even number of sites. In a small-volume limit\nwhere conformal invariance shows up in the theory, we derived conformal\ndimensions of states constructed through the lattice-regularized theory. The\nresult shows existence of the R sector, which cannot be obtained from the\nperiodic system, while a winding number is restricted to an integer or a\nhalf-integer depending on boundary parameters.\n'

S"  Rare data in a large-scale database are called outliers that reveal\nsignificant information in the real world. The subspace-based outlier detection\nis regarded as a feasible approach in very high dimensional space. However, the\noutliers found in subspaces are only part of the true outliers in high\ndimensional space, indeed. The outliers hidden in normal-clustered points are\nsometimes neglected in the projected dimensional subspace. In this paper, we\npropose a robust subspace method for detecting such inner outliers in a given\ndataset, which uses two dimensional-projections: detecting outliers in\nsubspaces with local density ratio in the first projected dimensions; finding\noutliers by comparing neighbor's positions in the second projected dimensions.\nEach point's weight is calculated by summing up all related values got in the\ntwo steps projected dimensions, and then the points scoring the largest weight\nvalues are taken as outliers. By taking a series of experiments with the number\nof dimensions from 10 to 10000, the results show that our proposed method\nachieves high precision in the case of extremely high dimensional space, and\nworks well in low dimensional space.\n"

To deepen the physical insight of our approach we\ndiscuss various self-consistent expressions for the response function, and\nderive the correlation time in closed form.

S'  We present a content-based retrieval method for long surveillance videos both\nfor wide-area (Airborne) as well as near-field imagery (CCTV). Our goal is to\nretrieve video segments, with a focus on detecting objects moving on routes,\nthat match user-defined events of interest. The sheer size and remote locations\nwhere surveillance videos are acquired, necessitates highly compressed\nrepresentations that are also meaningful for supporting user-defined queries.\nTo address these challenges we archive long-surveillance video through\nlightweight processing based on low-level local spatio-temporal extraction of\nmotion and object features. These are then hashed into an inverted index using\nlocality-sensitive hashing (LSH). This local approach allows for query\nflexibility as well as leads to significant gains in compression. Our second\ntask is to extract partial matches to the user-created query and assembles them\ninto full matches using Dynamic Programming (DP). DP exploits causality to\nassemble the indexed low level features into a video segment which matches the\nquery route. We examine CCTV and Airborne footage, whose low contrast makes\nmotion extraction more difficult. We generate robust motion estimates for\nAirborne data using a tracklets generation algorithm while we use Horn and\nSchunck approach to generate motion estimates for CCTV. Our approach handles\nlong routes, low contrasts and occlusion. We derive bounds on the rate of false\npositives and demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach for counting,\nmotion pattern recognition and abandoned object applications.\n'

S'  Recently regression analysis becomes a popular tool for face recognition. The\nexisting regression methods all use the one-dimensional pixel-based error\nmodel, which characterizes the representation error pixel by pixel individually\nand thus neglects the whole structure of the error image. We observe that\nocclusion and illumination changes generally lead to a low-rank error image. To\nmake use of this low-rank structural information, this paper presents a\ntwo-dimensional image matrix based error model, i.e. matrix regression, for\nface representation and classification. Our model uses the minimal nuclear norm\nof representation error image as a criterion, and the alternating direction\nmethod of multipliers method to calculate the regression coefficients. Compared\nwith the current regression methods, the proposed Nuclear Norm based Matrix\nRegression (NMR) model is more robust for alleviating the effect of\nillumination, and more intuitive and powerful for removing the structural noise\ncaused by occlusion. We experiment using four popular face image databases, the\nExtended Yale B database, the AR database, the Multi-PIE and the FRGC database.\nExperimental results demonstrate the performance advantage of NMR over the\nstate-of-the-art regression based face recognition methods.\n'

S'  We study the performance of a quantum Otto cycle driven by trapping\npotentials of the form $V_t(x) \\sim x^{2q}$. This family of potentials\npossesses a simple scaling property which allows for analytical insights into\nthe efficiency and work output of the cycle. We show that, while both the mean\nwork output and the efficiency of two Otto cycles in different trapping\npotentials can be made equal, the work probability distribution will still be\nstrongly affected by the difference in structure of the energy levels. Lastly,\nwe perform a comparison of quantum Otto cycles in various physically relevant\nscenarios and find that in certain instances, the efficiency of the cycle is\ngreater when using potentials with larger values of $q$, while, in other cases,\nwith harmonic traps.\n'

S'  MOOCs have the potential to revolutionize higher education with their wide\noutreach and accessibility, but they require instructors to come up with\nscalable alternates to traditional student evaluation. Peer grading -- having\nstudents assess each other -- is a promising approach to tackling the problem\nof evaluation at scale, since the number of "graders" naturally scales with the\nnumber of students. However, students are not trained in grading, which means\nthat one cannot expect the same level of grading skills as in traditional\nsettings. Drawing on broad evidence that ordinal feedback is easier to provide\nand more reliable than cardinal feedback, it is therefore desirable to allow\npeer graders to make ordinal statements (e.g. "project X is better than project\nY") and not require them to make cardinal statements (e.g. "project X is a\nB-"). Thus, in this paper we study the problem of automatically inferring\nstudent grades from ordinal peer feedback, as opposed to existing methods that\nrequire cardinal peer feedback. We formulate the ordinal peer grading problem\nas a type of rank aggregation problem, and explore several probabilistic models\nunder which to estimate student grades and grader reliability. We study the\napplicability of these methods using peer grading data collected from a real\nclass -- with instructor and TA grades as a baseline -- and demonstrate the\nefficacy of ordinal feedback techniques in comparison to existing cardinal peer\ngrading methods. Finally, we compare these peer-grading techniques to\ntraditional evaluation techniques.\n'

S'  A quantum spin Hall insulator is a two-dimensional state of matter consisting\nof an insulating bulk and one-dimensional helical edge states. While these edge\nstates are topologically protected against elastic backscattering in the\npresence of disorder, interaction-induced inelastic terms may yield a finite\nconductivity. By using a kinetic equation approach, we find the backscattering\nrate $\\tau^{-1}$ and the semiclassical conductivity in the regimes of high\n($\\omega \\gg \\tau^{-1}$) and low ($\\omega \\ll \\tau^{-1}$) frequency. By\ncomparing the two limits, we find that the parametric dependence of\nconductivity is described by the Drude formula for the case of a disordered\nedge. On the other hand, in the clean case where the resistance originates from\numklapp interactions, the conductivity takes a non-Drude form with a parametric\nsuppression of scattering in the dc limit as compared to the ac case. This\nbehavior is due to the peculiarity of umklapp scattering processes involving\nnecessarily the state at the "Dirac point". In order to take into account\nLuttinger liquid effects, we complement the kinetic equation analysis by\ntreating interactions exactly in bosonization and calculating conductivity\nusing the Kubo formula. In this way, we obtain the frequency and temperature\ndependence of conductivity over a wide range of parameters. We find the\ntemperature and frequency dependence of the transport scattering time in a\ndisordered system as $\\tau \\sim [\\max{(\\omega,T)}]^{-2K-2}$, for $K>2/3$ and\n$\\tau \\sim [\\max{(\\omega,T)}]^{-8K+2}$ for $K <2/3$.\n'

S'  We study the effects of extended and localized potentials and a magnetic\nfield on the Dirac electrons residing at the surface of a three-dimensional\ntopological insulator. We use a lattice model to numerically study the various\nstates; we show how the potentials can be chosen in a way which effectively\navoids the problem of fermion doubling on a lattice. We show that extended\npotentials of different shapes can give rise to states which propagate freely\nalong the potential but decay exponentially away from it. For an infinitely\nlong potential barrier, the dispersion and spin structure of these states are\nunusual and these can be varied continuously by changing the barrier strength.\nIn the presence of a magnetic field applied perpendicular to the surface, these\nstates become separated from the gapless surface states by a gap, thereby\ngiving rise to a quasi-one-dimensional system. Similarly, a magnetic field\nalong with a localized potential can give rise to exponentially localized\nstates which are separated from the surface states by a gap and thereby form a\nzero-dimensional system. Finally, we show that a long barrier and an impurity\npotential can produce bound states which are localized at the impurity, and an\n"L"-shaped potential can have both bound states at the corner of the "L" and\nextended states which travel along the arms of the potential.\n'

S'  We show by means of molecular dynamics simulations that graphene is an\nexcellent coating for diamond. The transformation of diamond to amorphous\ncarbon while sliding under pressure can be prevented by having at least two\ngraphene layers between the diamond slabs, making this combination of materials\nsuitable for new coatings and micro- and nanoelectromechanical devices. Grain\nboundaries, vacancies and adatoms on the diamond surface do not change this\npicture whereas reactive adsorbates between the graphene layers may have\ndetrimental effects. Our findings can be explained by the properties of layered\nmaterials where the weak interlayer bonding evolves to a strong interlayer\nrepulsion under pressure.\n'

S'  When a micron-sized magnetizable particle is introduced into a suspension of\nnanosized magnetic particles, the nanoparticles accumulate around the\nmicroparticle and form thick anisotropic clouds extended in the direction of\nthe applied magnetic field. This phenomenon promotes colloidal stabilization of\nbimodal magnetic suspensions and allows efficient magnetic separation of\nnanoparticles used in bioanalysis and water purification. In the present work,\nsize and shape of nanoparticle clouds under the simultaneous action of an\nexternal uniform magnetic field and the flow have been studied in details. In\nexperiments, dilute suspension of iron oxide nanoclusters (of a mean diameter\nof 60 nm) was pushed through a thin slit channel with the nickel microspheres\n(of a mean diameter of 50$\\mu$m) attached to the channel wall. The behavior of\nnanocluster clouds was observed in the steady state using an optical\nmicroscope. In the presence of strong enough flow, the size of the clouds\nmonotonically decreases with increasing flow speed in both longitudinal and\ntransverse magnetic fields. This is qualitatively explained by enhancement of\nhydrodynamic forces washing the nanoclusters away from the clouds. In the\nlongitudinal field, the flow induces asymmetry of the front and the back\nclouds. To explain the flow and the field effects on the clouds, we have\ndeveloped a simple model based on the balance of the stresses and particle\nfluxes on the cloud surface. This model, applied to the case of the magnetic\nfield parallel to the flow, captures reasonably well the flow effect on the\nsize and shape of the cloud and reveals that the only dimensionless parameter\ngoverning the cloud size is the ratio of hydrodynamic-to-magnetic forces - the\nMason number. At strong magnetic interactions considered in the present work\n(dipolar coupling parameter $\\alpha \\geq 2$), the Brownian motion seems not to\naffect the cloud behavior.\n'

S'  We describe a generic theoretical framework, denoted as the\nBoltzmann-Ginzburg-Landau approach, to derive continuous equations for the\npolar and/or nematic order parameters describing the large scale behavior of\nassemblies of point-like active particles interacting through polar or nematic\nalignment rules. Our study encompasses three main classes of dry active\nsystems, namely polar particles with \'ferromagnetic\' alignment (like the\noriginal Vicsek model), nematic particles with nematic alignment ("active\nnematics"), and polar particles with nematic alignment ("self-propelled rods").\nThe Boltzmann-Ginzburg-Landau approach combines a low-density description in\nthe form of a Boltzmann equation, with a Ginzburg-Landau-type expansion close\nto the instability threshold of the disordered state. We provide the generic\nform of the continuous equations obtained for each class, and comment on the\nrelationships and differences with other approaches.\n'

S'  We study the stochastic behavior of heterogeneous diffusion processes with\nthe power-law dependence $D(x)\\sim|x|^{\\alpha}$ of the generalized diffusion\ncoefficient encompassing sub- and superdiffusive anomalous diffusion. Based on\nstatistical measures such as the amplitude scatter of the time averaged mean\nsquared displacement of individual realizations, the ergodicity breaking and\nnon-Gaussianity parameters, as well as the probability density function\n$P(x,t)$ we analyze the weakly non-ergodic character of the heterogeneous\ndiffusion process and, particularly, the degree of irreproducibility of\nindividual realization. As we show, the fluctuations between individual\nrealizations increase with growing modulus $|\\alpha|$ of the scaling exponent.\nThe fluctuations appear to diverge when the critical value $\\alpha=2$ is\napproached, while for even larger $\\alpha$ the fluctuations decrease, again. At\ncriticality, the power-law behavior of the mean squared displacement changes to\nan exponentially fast growth, and the fluctuations of the time averaged mean\nsquared displacement do not seem to converge for increasing number of\nrealizations. From a systematic comparison we observe some striking\nsimilarities of the heterogeneous diffusion process with the familiar\nsubdiffusive continuous time random walk process with power-law waiting time\ndistribution and diverging characteristic waiting time.\n'

S'  Wang et al. [PNAS 106 (2009) 15160] have found that in several systems the\nlinear time dependence of the mean-square displacement (MSD) of diffusing\ncolloidal particles, typical of normal diffusion, is accompanied by a\nnon-Gaussian displacement distribution (DisD), with roughly exponential tails\nat short times, a situation they termed "anomalous yet Brownian" diffusion. The\ndiversity of systems in which this is observed calls for a generic model. We\npresent such a model where there is "diffusivity memory" but no "direction\nmemory" in the particle trajectory, and we show that it leads to both a linear\nMSD and a non-Gaussian DisD at short times. In our model, the diffusivity is\nundergoing a (perhaps biased) random walk, hence the expression "diffusing\ndiffusivity". The DisD is predicted to be exactly exponential at short times if\nthe distribution of diffusivities is itself exponential, but an exponential\nremains a good fit to the DisD for a variety of diffusivity distributions.\nMoreover, our generic model can be modified to produce subdiffusion.\n'

Upon applying a transverse magnetic\nfield to the single-ion magnet, we observe oscillations of the Kondo effect due\nto the presence of diabolical (degeneracy) points of the energy spectrum of the\nmolecule caused by a geometrical phase interference effects similar to those\nobserved in the quantum tunneling of multi-ion molecular nanomagnets. The\nfield-induced lifting of the ground state degeneracy competes with the\ninterference modulation, resulting in some cases in a suppression of the Kondo\npeak.\n'

S'  Accurate distance measurement in 3D confocal microscopy is important for\nquantitative analysis, volume visualization and image restoration. However,\naxial distances can be distorted by both the point spread function and by a\nrefractive-index mismatch between the sample and immersion liquid, which are\ndifficult to separate. Additionally, accurate calibration of the axial\ndistances in confocal microscopy remains cumbersome, although several high-end\nmethods exist. In this paper we present two methods to calibrate axial\ndistances in 3D confocal microscopy that are both accurate and easily\nimplemented. With these methods, we measured axial scaling factors as a\nfunction of refractive-index mismatch for high-aperture confocal microscopy\nimaging. We found that our scaling factors are almost completely linearly\ndependent on refractive index and that they were in good agreement with\ntheoretical predictions that take the full vectorial properties of light into\naccount. There was however a strong deviation with the theoretical predictions\nusing (high-angle) geometrical optics, which predict much lower scaling\nfactors. As an illustration, we measured the point-spread-function of a\npoint-scanning confocal microscope and showed that an index-matched,\nmicron-sized spherical object is still significantly elongated due to this PSF,\nwhich confirms that single micron-sized spheres are not well suited to\ndetermine accurate axial calibration nor axial scaling.\n'

We show that, for the sudden\nquench, it is in general possible to retrieve the whole non-equilibrium\nthermodynamics via single projective measurements of observables. We highlight\nin a physically clear way the qualitative implications for the statistics of\nwork coming from considering processes described by operators that either\ncommute or do not commute with the unperturbed Hamiltonian of a given system.\nWe consider a quantum many-body system and derive an expression that allows us\nto give a physical interpretation to all of the cumulants of the work in the\ncase of quenched operators commuting with the unperturbed Hamiltonian. In the\ncommuting case the observables that we need to measure have an intuitive\nphysical meaning. Conversely in the non-commuting case, irrespectively of the\nsize of the quench, we show that it is possible to operate still with single\nprojective measurements but we derive an explicit expression for all the\ncumulants of the work that shows that physical properties are not so simply\ndecoded from those quantities. This circumstance makes the study of the physics\nof the system non-trivial as well as the emergence of thermodynamics from the\nfully quantum microscopic description. Interested in the criticality of a\nmany-body system, we illustrate our ideas with the example of the Ising model\nin a transverse field.\n'

S"  Noether's theorem is a fundamental result in physics stating that every\nsymmetry of the dynamics implies a conservation law. It is, however, deficient\nin several respects: (i) it is not applicable to dynamics wherein the system\ninteracts with an environment, and (ii) even in the case where the system is\nisolated, if the quantum state is mixed then the Noether conservation laws do\nnot capture all of the consequences of the symmetries. To address these\ndeficiencies, we introduce measures of the extent to which a quantum state\nbreaks a symmetry. Such measures yield novel constraints on state transitions:\nfor nonisolated systems, they cannot increase, while for isolated systems they\nare conserved. We demonstrate that the problem of finding nontrivial asymmetry\nmeasures can be solved using the tools of quantum information theory.\nApplications include deriving model-independent bounds on the quantum noise in\namplifiers and assessing quantum schemes for achieving high-precision\nmetrology.\n"

S'  A theoretical proposal for realizing and detecting spin supercurrent in an\nisotropic antiferromagnetic insulator is reported. Superfluid spin transport is\nachieved by inserting the antiferromagnet between two metallic reservoirs and\nestablishing a spin accumulation in one reservoir such that a spin bias is\napplied across the magnet. We consider a class of bipartite antiferromagnets\nwith Neel ground states, and temperatures well below the ordering temperature,\nwhere spin transport is mediated essentially by the condensate. Landau-Lifshitz\nand magneto-circuit theories are used to directly relate spin current in\ndifferent parts of the heterostructure to the spin-mixing conductances\ncharacterizing the antiferromagnet|metal interfaces and the antiferromagnet\nbulk damping parameters, quantities all obtainable from experiments. We study\nthe efficiency of spin angular-momentum transfer at an antiferromagnet|metal\ninterface by developing a microscopic scattering theory for the interface and\nextracting the spin-mixing conductance for a simple model. Within the model, a\nquantitative comparison between the spin-mixing conductances obtained for the\nantiferromagnet|metal and ferromagnet|metal interfaces is made.\n'

S'  Variable-amplitude oscillatory shear tests are emerging as powerful tools to\ninvestigate and quantify the nonlinear rheology of amorphous solids, complex\nfluids and biological materials. Quite a few recent experimental and atomistic\nsimulation studies demonstrated that at low shear amplitudes, an amorphous\nsolid settles into an amplitude- and initial conditions-dependent dissipative\nlimit cycle, in which back-and-forth localized particle rearrangements\nperiodically bring the system to the same state. At sufficiently large shear\namplitudes, the amorphous system loses memory of the initial conditions,\nexhibits chaotic particle motions accompanied by diffusive behavior and settles\ninto a stochastic steady-state. The two regimes are separated by a transition\namplitude, possibly characterized by some critical-like features. Here we argue\nthat these observations support some of the physical assumptions embodied in\nthe nonequilibrium thermodynamic, internal-variables based,\nShear-Transformation-Zone model of amorphous visco-plasticity; most notably\nthat "flow defects" in amorphous solids are characterized by internal states\nbetween which they can make transitions, and that structural evolution is\ndriven by dissipation associated with plastic deformation. We present a rather\nextensive theoretical analysis of the thermodynamic Shear-Transformation-Zone\nmodel for a variable-amplitude oscillatory shear protocol, highlighting its\nsuccess in accounting for various experimental and simulational observations,\nas well as its limitations. Our results offer a continuum-level theoretical\nframework for interpreting the variable-amplitude oscillatory shear response of\namorphous solids and may promote additional developments.\n'

S'  We consider the problem of inferring the conditional independence graph (CIG)\nof a multivariate stationary dicrete-time Gaussian random process based on a\nfinite length observation. Using information-theoretic methods, we derive a\nlower bound on the error probability of any learning scheme for the underlying\nprocess CIG. This bound, in turn, yields a minimum required sample-size which\nis necessary for any algorithm regardless of its computational complexity, to\nreliably select the true underlying CIG. Furthermore, by analysis of a simple\nselection scheme, we show that the information-theoretic limits can be achieved\nfor a subclass of processes having sparse CIG. We do not assume a parametric\nmodel for the observed process, but require it to have a sufficiently smooth\nspectral density matrix (SDM).\n'

S"  Silicene, a hexagonal buckled 2-D allotrope of silicon, shows potential as a\nplatform for numerous new applications, and may allow for easier integration\nwith existing silicon-based microelectronics than graphene. Here, we show that\nsilicene could function as an ultrafast electrical DNA sequencing device. We\ninvestigated the stability of this novel nano-bio system, its electronic\nproperties and the pronounced effects on the transverse electronic transport,\ni.e., changes in the transmission and the conductance caused by adsorption of\neach nucleobase, explored by us through the non-equilibrium Green's function\nmethod. Intriguingly, despite the relatively weak interaction between\nnucleobases and silicene, significant changes in the transmittance at zero bias\nare predicted by us, in particular for the two nucleobases cytosine and\nguanine. Our findings suggest that silicene could be utilized as an\nintegrated-circuit biosensor as part of a lab-on-a-chip device for DNA\nsequencing.\n"

This mapping is then exploited to optimize the dynamics and produce\nlarge amounts of entanglement distributed in very special ways.

S'  We report on the anomalous behavior of control pulses for spins subject to\nclassical noise with a singular autocorrelation function. This behavior is not\ndetected for noise with analytic autocorrelation functions. The effect is\nmanifest in the different scaling behavior of the deviation of a real pulse to\nthe ideal, instantaneous one. While a standard pulse displays scaling $\\propto\n\\tau_\\mathrm{p}^1$, a first-order refocusing pulse normally shows scaling\n$\\propto \\tau_\\mathrm{p}^2$. But in presence of cusps in the noise\nautocorrelation the scaling $\\propto \\tau_\\mathrm{p}^{3/2}$ occurs. Cusps in\nthe autocorrelation are characteristic for the omnipresent Ornstein-Uhlenbeck\nprocess. We prove that the anomalous exponent cannot be avoided; it represents\na fundamental limit. On the one hand, this redefines the strategies one has to\nadopt to design refocusing pulses. On the other hand, the anomalous exponent,\nif found in experiment, provides important information on the noise properties.\n'

S"  Entanglement measures such as the entanglement entropy have become an\nindispensable tool to identify the fundamental character of ground states of\ninteracting quantum many-body systems. For systems of interacting spin or\nbosonic degrees of freedom much recent progress has been made not only in the\nanalytical description of their respective entanglement entropies but also in\ntheir numerical classification. Systems of interacting fermionic degrees of\nfreedom however have proved to be more difficult to control, in particular with\nregard to the numerical understanding of their entanglement properties. Here we\nreport a generalization of the replica technique for the calculation of Renyi\nentropies to the framework of determinantal Quantum Monte Carlo simulations --\nthe numerical method of choice for unbiased, large-scale simulations of\ninteracting fermionic systems. We demonstrate the strength of this approach\nover a recent alternative proposal based on a decomposition in free fermion\nGreen's functions by studying the entanglement entropy of one-dimensional\nHubbard systems both at zero and finite temperatures.\n"

We give\nevidence that the magnitude of the largest anticipation time depends on the\ndynamical regime where the system operates (defect turbulence, phase turbulence\nor bichaos) and scales with the linear autocorrelation time of the system.\nMoreover, we find that the largest anticipation times are obtained for\ncomplex-valued coupling constants.

S'  Finding rare information hidden in a huge amount of data from the Internet is\na necessary but complex issue. Many researchers have studied this issue and\nhave found effective methods to detect anomaly data in low dimensional space.\nHowever, as the dimension increases, most of these existing methods perform\npoorly in detecting outliers because of "high dimensional curse". Even though\nsome approaches aim to solve this problem in high dimensional space, they can\nonly detect some anomaly data appearing in low dimensional space and cannot\ndetect all of anomaly data which appear differently in high dimensional space.\nTo cope with this problem, we propose a new k-nearest section-based method\n(k-NS) in a section-based space. Our proposed approach not only detects\noutliers in low dimensional space with section-density ratio but also detects\noutliers in high dimensional space with the ratio of k-nearest section against\naverage value. After taking a series of experiments with the dimension from 10\nto 10000, the experiment results show that our proposed method achieves 100%\nprecision and 100% recall result in the case of extremely high dimensional\nspace, and better improvement in low dimensional space compared to our\npreviously proposed method.\n'

S"  In this paper, a mathematical theory of learning is proposed that has many\nparallels with information theory. We consider Vapnik's General Setting of\nLearning in which the learning process is defined to be the act of selecting a\nhypothesis in response to a given training set. Such hypothesis can, for\nexample, be a decision boundary in classification, a set of centroids in\nclustering, or a set of frequent item-sets in association rule mining.\nDepending on the hypothesis space and how the final hypothesis is selected, we\nshow that a learning process can be assigned a numeric score, called learning\ncapacity, which is analogous to Shannon's channel capacity and satisfies\nsimilar interesting properties as well such as the data-processing inequality\nand the information-cannot-hurt inequality. In addition, learning capacity\nprovides the tightest possible bound on the difference between true risk and\nempirical risk of the learning process for all loss functions that are\nparametrized by the chosen hypothesis. It is also shown that the notion of\nlearning capacity equivalently quantifies how sensitive the choice of the final\nhypothesis is to a small perturbation in the training set. Consequently,\nalgorithmic stability is both necessary and sufficient for generalization.\nWhile the theory does not rely on concentration inequalities, we finally show\nthat analogs to classical results in learning theory using the Probably\nApproximately Correct (PAC) model can be immediately deduced using this theory,\nand conclude with information-theoretic bounds to learning capacity.\n"

The number of chiral Floquet Majorana edge states is confirmed\nby calculating Chern number analytically and energy spectrum in ribbon\ngeometry. Moreover, this proposal is generalized to other hexagonal lattice\nsystems, such as monolayer graphene and silicene. Notably, the parameter range\nof induced light to achieve the chiral Floquet Majorana edge states is\nexperimentally feasible, and the corresponding Floquet Majorana fermions can be\nprobed based on differential conductance using scanning tunneling spectroscopy.\n'

S'  We present a fast direct algorithm for computing symmetric factorizations,\ni.e. $A = WW^T$, of symmetric positive-definite hierarchical matrices with\nweak-admissibility conditions. The computational cost for the symmetric\nfactorization scales as $\\mathcal{O}(n \\log^2 n)$ for hierarchically\noff-diagonal low-rank matrices. Once this factorization is obtained, the cost\nfor inversion, application, and determinant computation scales as\n$\\mathcal{O}(n \\log n)$. In particular, this allows for the near optimal\ngeneration of correlated random variates in the case where $A$ is a covariance\nmatrix. This symmetric factorization algorithm depends on two key ingredients.\nFirst, we present a novel symmetric factorization formula for low-rank updates\nto the identity of the form $I+UKU^T$. This factorization can be computed in\n$\\mathcal{O}(n)$ time, if the rank of the perturbation is sufficiently small.\nSecond, combining this formula with a recursive divide-and-conquer strategy,\nnear linear complexity symmetric factorizations for hierarchically structured\nmatrices can be obtained. We present numerical results for matrices relevant to\nproblems in probability \\& statistics (Gaussian processes), interpolation\n(Radial basis functions), and Brownian dynamics calculations in fluid mechanics\n(the Rotne-Prager-Yamakawa tensor).\n'

S"  In graphene placed on hexagonal boron nitride, replicas of the original Dirac\nspectrum appear near edges of superlattice minibands. More such replicas\ndevelop in high magnetic fields, and their quantization gives rise to a fractal\npattern of Landau levels, referred to as the Hofstadter butterfly. Some\nevidence for the butterfly has recently been reported by using transport\nmeasurements. Here we employ capacitance spectroscopy to probe directly the\ndensity of states and energy gaps in graphene superlattices. Without magnetic\nfield, replica spectra are seen as pronounced minima in the density of states\nsurrounded by van Hove singularities. The Hofstadter butterfly shows up in\nmagnetocapacitance clearer than in transport measurements and, near one flux\nquantum per superlattice unit cell, we observe Landau fan diagrams related to\nquantization of Dirac replicas in a reduced magnetic field. Electron-electron\ninteraction strongly modifies the superlattice spectrum. In particular, we find\nthat graphene's quantum Hall ferromagnetism, due to lifted spin and valley\ndegeneracies, exhibits a reverse Stoner transition at commensurable fluxes and\nthat Landau levels of Dirac replicas support their own ferromagnetic states.\n"

We present a theory\nfor estimating $f_1$ in settings where $f_2(X_2)$ is more complex than\n$f_1(X_1)$. The proposed estimation procedure combines two least squares\ncriteria and can be written as an alternating projection procedure.

As an example we apply the results to an\nadditive model where the number of covariates is large or the nuisance\ncomponents are considerably less smooth than $f_1$.\n'

S'  There exist two scenarios of quantum weak measurement theories. One is the\nwell-known quantum trajectory theory which, in terms of continuous differential\nequation, has been broadly applied in quantum optics and quantum control\nproblems. Another is the relatively newer quantum Bayesian approach, which has\nthe advantage of being more efficient to infer the state of the measured\nquantum system merely based on certain integrated output of measurements. In\nthis work, we aim to develop a quantum Bayesian rule for weak measurements of\nqubits in circuit quantum electrodynamics (QED). Starting with the optical\nquantum trajectory equation, our analysis pays particular attention to the\nnature of the cavity field under continuous quadrature monitoring. This allows\nour treatment unrestricted to the "bad-cavity" and weak-response limits, thus\nmaking the obtained rule applicable to general setup parameters. With accuracy\nwell proven numerically in this work, we expect this proposed approach to be\nuseful for future circuit-QED measurement and control experiments.\n'

S'  Several sensing concepts using nanostructures prepared by focused electron\nbeam induced deposition have been developed over the last years. Following work\non highly miniaturized Hall sensors for magnetic sensing with soft magnetic Co,\nstrain and force sensing based on nano-granular platinum-carbon structures\n(Pt(C)) was introduced. Very recently the capability of nano-granular Pt(C)\nstructures to detect the presence of adsorbate water layers by conductance\nmodulations was demonstrated. For magnetic and strain sensing the underlying\nphysical mechanisms of the sensing effect have been analyzed in detail and are\nnow quite well understood. This is not the case for the adsorbate layer induced\nconductance modulation effect. Here we provide a theoretical framework that\nallows for a semi-quantitative understanding of the observed water-sensing\neffect. We show how the near-interface renormalization of the Coulomb charging\nenergy in the nano-granular metal caused by the dielectric screening of the\npolarizable adsorbate layer leads to a conductance modulation. The model can\naccount for the conductance modulation observed in the water adsorbate\nexperiments and can also be applied to understand similar effects caused by\nnear-interface dielectric anomalies of ferroelectric thin films on top of\nnano-granular Pt(C). Our findings provide a pathway towards optimized\nnano-granular layer structures suitable for a wide range of dielectric or local\npotential sensing applications.\n'

S'  In this paper, we study the problem of learning a monotone DNF with at most\n$s$ terms of size (number of variables in each term) at most $r$ ($s$ term\n$r$-MDNF) from membership queries. This problem is equivalent to the problem of\nlearning a general hypergraph using hyperedge-detecting queries, a problem\nmotivated by applications arising in chemical reactions and genome sequencing.\n  We first present new lower bounds for this problem and then present\ndeterministic and randomized adaptive algorithms with query complexities that\nare almost optimal. All the algorithms we present in this paper run in time\nlinear in the query complexity and the number of variables $n$. In addition,\nall of the algorithms we present in this paper are asymptotically tight for\nfixed $r$ and/or $s$.\n'

S"  Separating an image into cartoon and texture components comes useful in image\nprocessing applications, such as image compression, image segmentation, image\ninpainting. Yves Meyer's influential cartoon texture decomposition model\ninvolves deriving an energy functional by choosing appropriate spaces and\nfunctionals. Minimizers of the derived energy functional are cartoon and\ntexture components of an image. In this study, cartoon part of an image is\nseparated, by reconstructing it from pixels of multi scale Total-Variation\nfiltered versions of the original image which is sought to be decomposed into\ncartoon and texture parts. An information theoretic pixel by pixel selection\ncriteria is employed to choose the contributing pixels and their scales.\n"

S'  In binary classification and regression problems, it is well understood that\nLipschitz continuity and smoothness of the loss function play key roles in\ngoverning generalization error bounds for empirical risk minimization\nalgorithms. In this paper, we show how these two properties affect\ngeneralization error bounds in the learning to rank problem. The learning to\nrank problem involves vector valued predictions and therefore the choice of the\nnorm with respect to which Lipschitz continuity and smoothness are defined\nbecomes crucial. Choosing the $\\ell_\\infty$ norm in our definition of Lipschitz\ncontinuity allows us to improve existing bounds. Furthermore, under smoothness\nassumptions, our choice enables us to prove rates that interpolate between\n$1/\\sqrt{n}$ and $1/n$ rates. Application of our results to ListNet, a popular\nlearning to rank method, gives state-of-the-art performance guarantees.\n'

S'  A new approach to maximum likelihood learning of discrete graphical models\nand RBM in particular is introduced. Our method, Perturb and Descend (PD) is\ninspired by two ideas (I) perturb and MAP method for sampling (II) learning by\nContrastive Divergence minimization. In contrast to perturb and MAP, PD\nleverages training data to learn the models that do not allow efficient MAP\nestimation. During the learning, to produce a sample from the current model, we\nstart from a training data and descend in the energy landscape of the\n"perturbed model", for a fixed number of steps, or until a local optima is\nreached. For RBM, this involves linear calculations and thresholding which can\nbe very fast. Furthermore we show that the amount of perturbation is closely\nrelated to the temperature parameter and it can regularize the model by\nproducing robust features resulting in sparse hidden layer activation.\n'

In this paper we use the newly developed DG method to\nsolve a mathematical model for early stages of atherosclerotic plaque\nformation. Atherosclerotic plaque is mainly formed by accumulation of\nlipid-laden cells in the arterial walls which leads to a heart attack in case\nthe artery is occluded or a thrombus is built through a rupture of the plaque.\nAfter describing a mathematical model and the discretization scheme, we present\nsome benchmark tests comparing the CDG2 method to other commonly used DG\nmethods. Furthermore, we take parallelization and higher order discretization\nschemes into account.\n'

S"  The homogenization of auxetic cellular solids having periodic hexachiral and\ntetrachiral microstructure is dealt with two different techniques. The first\napproach is based on the representation of the cellular solid as a beam-lattice\nto be homogenized as a micropolar continuum. The second approach is developed\nto analyse periodic cells conceived as a two-dimensional domain consisting of\ndeformable portions such as the ring, the ligaments and possibly an embedded\nmatrix internally to these. This approach is based on a second displacement\ngradient computational homogenization proposed by the Authors (Bacigalupo and\nGambarotta, 2010). The elastic moduli obtained by the micropolar homogenization\nare expressed in analytical form from which it appears explicitly their\ndependence on the parameter of chirality, which is the angle of inclination of\nthe ligaments with respect to the grid of lines connecting the centers of the\nrings. For hexachiral cells, the solution of Liu et al., 2012, is found,\nshowing the auxetic property of the lattice together with the elastic coupling\nmodulus between the normal and the asymmetric strains; a property that has been\nconfirmed here for the tetrachiral lattice. Unlike the hexagonal lattice, the\nclassical constitutive equations of the tetragonal lattice turns out to be\ncharacterized by the coupling between the normal and shear strains through an\nelastic modulus that is an odd function of the parameter of chirality.\nMoreover, this lattice is found to exhibit a remarkable variability of the\nYoung's modulus and of the Poisson's ratio with the direction of the applied\nuniaxial stress. The properties of the equivalent micropolar continuum are\nqualitatively detected also in the equivalent second-gradient continuum.\n"

Strong convergence results are\npresented for the case of locally Lipschitz coefficients.

S'  In this paper, we develop parametrized positivity satisfying flux limiters\nfor the high order finite difference Runge-Kutta weighted essentially\nnon-oscillatory (WENO) scheme solving compressible Euler equations to maintain\npositive density and pressure. Negative density and pressure, which often leads\nto simulation blow-ups or nonphysical solutions, emerges from many high\nresolution computations in some extreme cases. The methodology we propose in\nthis paper is a nontrivial generalization of the parametrized maximum principle\npreserving flux limiters for high order finite difference schemes solving\nscalar hyperbolic conservation laws [22, 10, 20]. To preserve the maximum\nprinciple, the high order flux is limited towards a first order monotone flux,\nwhere the limiting procedures are designed by decoupling linear maximum\nprinciple constraints. High order schemes with such flux limiters are shown to\npreserve the high order accuracy via local truncation error analysis and by\nextensive numerical experiments with mild CFL constraints. The parametrized\nflux limiting approach is generalized to the Euler system to preserve the\npositivity of density and pressure of numerical solutions via decoupling some\nnonlinear constraints. Compared with existing high order positivity preserving\napproaches [24, 26, 25], our proposed algorithm is positivity preserving by the\ndesign; it is computationally efficient and maintains high order spatial and\ntemporal accuracy in our extensive numerical tests. Numerical tests are\nperformed to demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed new\nalgorithm.\n'

S'  We describe a new method for superresolution of still images (in the wavelet\ndomain) based on the reconstruction of missing details subbands pixels at a\ngiven ith level via Rule of Three (Ro3) between pixels of approximation subband\nof such level, and pixels of approximation and detail subbands of (i+1)th\nlevel. The histogramic profiles demonstrate that Ro3 is the appropriate\nmechanism to recover missing detail subband pixels in these cases. Besides,\nwith the elimination of the details subbands pixels (in an eventual compression\nscheme), we obtain a bigger compression rate. Experimental results demonstrate\nthat our approach compares favorably to more typical methods of denoising and\ncompression in wavelet domain. Our method does not compress, but facilitates\nthe action of the real compressor, in our case, Joint Photographic Experts\nGroup (JPEG) and JPEg2000, that is, Ro3 acts as a catalyst compression\n'

S'  In this chapter a general mathematical model of Optical Coherence Tomography\n(OCT) is presented on the basis of the electromagnetic theory. OCT produces\nhigh resolution images of the inner structure of biological tissues. Images are\nobtained by measuring the time delay and the intensity of the backscattered\nlight from the sample considering also the coherence properties of light. The\nscattering problem is considered for a weakly scattering medium located far\nenough from the detector. The inverse problem is to reconstruct the\nsusceptibility of the medium given the measurements for different positions of\nthe mirror. Different approaches are addressed depending on the different\nassumptions made about the optical properties of the sample. This procedure is\napplied to a full field OCT system and an extension to standard (time and\nfrequency domain) OCT is briefly presented.\n'

S"  Accurate upper-lower bounds on homogenized matrix, arising from the unit cell\nproblem for periodic media, are calculated for a scalar elliptic setting. Our\napproach builds on the recent variational reformulation of the Moulinec-Suquet\n(1994) Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) homogenization scheme by Vond\\v{r}ejc et\nal. (2014), which is based on the conforming Galerkin approximation with\ntrigonometric polynomials. Upper-lower bounds are obtained by adjusting the\nprimal-dual finite element framework developed independently by Dvo\\v{r}\\'{a}k\n(1993) and Wi\\c{e}ckowski (1995) to the FFT-based Galerkin setting. We show\nthat the discretization procedure differs for odd and non-odd number of\ndiscretization points. In particular, thanks to the Helmholtz decomposition\ninherited from the continuous formulation, the duality structure is fully\nrecovered for odd discretization. In the latter case, the more complex\nprimal-dual structure is observed due to the trigonometric polynomials\nassociated with the Nyquist frequencies. These theoretical findings are\nconfirmed with numerical examples. To conclude, the main advantage of the\nFFT-based approach over the two finite-element schemes of Dvo\\v{r}\\'{a}k and\nWi\\c{e}ckowski is that the primal and the dual problems can be treated on the\nsame basis, and this property can be extended beyond the scalar elliptic\nproblem.\n"

S'  We derive a nonparametric test for constant (continuous) beta over a fixed\ninterval of time. Continuous beta is defined as the ratio of the continuous\ncovariation between an asset and observable risk factor (e.g., the market\nreturn) and the continuous variation of the latter. Our test is based on\ndiscrete observations of a bivariate \\Ito semimartingale with mesh of the\nobservation grid shrinking to zero. We first form a consistent and\nasymptotically mixed normal estimate of beta using all the observations within\nthe time interval under the null hypothesis that beta is constant. Using it we\nform an estimate of the residual component of the asset returns that is\northogonal (in martingale sense) to the risk factor. Our test is then based on\nthe distinctive asymptotic behavior, under the null and alternative hypothesis,\nof the sample covariation between the risk factor and the estimated residual\ncomponent of the asset returns over blocks with asymptotically shrinking time\nspan. We document satisfactory finite sample properties of the test on\nsimulated data. In an empirical application based on 10-minute data we analyze\nthe time variation in market betas of four assets over the period\n$2006$--$2012$. The results suggest that (for likely structural reasons) for\none of the assets there is statistically nontrivial variation in market beta\neven for a period as short as a week. On the other hand, for the rest of the\nassets in our analysis we find evidence that a window of constant beta of one\nweek to one month is statistically plausible.\n'

We show that given a\nnonnegative real matrix $A$, a $\\sigma\\geq\\rho(A)$ and a vector $\\boldsymbol\nw>0$ such that $A\\boldsymbol w\\leq\\sigma\\boldsymbol w$, every iteration of\nstep-asynchronous successive overrelaxation for the problem $(sI- A)\\boldsymbol\nx=\\boldsymbol b$, with $s >\\sigma$, reduces geometrically the $\\boldsymbol\nw$-norm of the current error by a factor that we can compute explicitly.

This property makes it possible to estimate the\nsupremum norm of the absolute error at each iteration without any additional\nhypothesis on $A$, even when $A$ is so large that computing the product\n$A\\boldsymbol x$ is feasible, but estimating the supremum norm of $(sI-A)^{-1}$\nis not.\n'

S'  In the presence of axial magnetic fields, which can be realized in\ndeliberately buckled monolayer graphene, quasi-relativistic Dirac fermions can\nfind themselves in various broken symmetry phases even for weak interactions.\nThrough a detailed Hartree self-consistent numerical calculation in finite\nstrained graphene, with cylindrical and open boundaries, we establish the\npossibility of realizing a charge-density-wave order for the spinless fermions\nin the presence of weak nearest-neighbor repulsion. Such an instability gives\nrise to a staggered pattern of average fermionic density between the the bulk\nand the edge of the system, as well as among the two sublattices of graphene,\ndue to the spatial separation of the zero energy states, localized on two\ndistinct sublattices. Although with fermions spin restored, an unconventional\nmagnetic order, driven by the onsite repulsion, possibly leads to the dominant\ninstability at the Dirac point, the proposed charge-density-wave order can,\nnevertheless, be realized at finite doping, which is always accompanied by a\nfinite ferromagnetic moment. Additionally, the charge-density-wave phase\nsupports a quantized charge or spin Hall conductivity, when its formation away\nfrom the Dirac point, is preceded by the appearance of topological anomalous or\nspin Hall insulator, on the other hand supported by the second neighbor\nrepulsion, respectively. Therefore, depending on the relative strength of\nvarious short-ranged components of the Coulomb interaction, a variety of broken\nsymmetry phases can be realized within the zero energy manifold in strained\ngraphene.\n'

S'  Similarity comparisons of the form "Is object a more similar to b than to c?"\nare useful for computer vision and machine learning applications.\nUnfortunately, an embedding of $n$ points is specified by $n^3$ triplets,\nmaking collecting every triplet an expensive task. In noticing this difficulty,\nother researchers have investigated more intelligent triplet sampling\ntechniques, but they do not study their effectiveness or their potential\ndrawbacks. Although it is important to reduce the number of collected triplets,\nit is also important to understand how best to display a triplet collection\ntask to a user. In this work we explore an alternative display for collecting\ntriplets and analyze the monetary cost and speed of the display. We propose\nbest practices for creating cost effective human intelligence tasks for\ncollecting triplets. We show that rather than changing the sampling algorithm,\nsimple changes to the crowdsourcing UI can lead to much higher quality\nembeddings. We also provide a dataset as well as the labels collected from\ncrowd workers.\n'

For ellipsoids, we provide a bound in terms\nof the distance between these ellipsoids and simple functions of their\npolynomial coefficients. As an application, this theorem provides bounds for\ncompressive classification of convex sets. Rather than assuming that the data\nto be classified is sparse, our results show that the data can be acquired via\nvery few measurements yet will remain linearly separable.

S'  Condensation of fluctuations is an interesting phenomenon conceptually\ndistinct from condensation on average. One stricking feature is that, contrary\nto what happens on average, condensation of fluctuations may occurr even in the\nabsence of interaction. The explanation emerges from the duality between large\ndeviation events in the given system and typical events in a new and\nappropriately biased system. This surprising phenomenon is investigated in the\ncontext of the Gaussian model, chosen as paradigmatical non interacting system,\nbefore and after an istantaneous temperature quench. It is shown that the bias\ninduces a mean-field-like effective interaction responsible of the condensation\non average. Phase diagrams, covering both the equilibrium and the\noff-equilibrium regimes, are derived for observables representative of generic\nbehaviors.\n'

S"  We probe the complex rheology of nearly ideal 3d foam by flowing through a\nnarrow column. The foams we investigate have large bubble size, to minimize the\neffects of coarsening, and are very dry. Foams of this type cannot be studied\nvia conventional rheometry. The foam flows upward through a vertical\nrectangular column with a 4:1 cross-sectional aspect ratio, by bubbling gas\nthrough a soapy solution at the base of our apparatus. At the column's narrow\nsurfaces are sticky boundaries, which create shear due to the zero velocity\nboundary condition. As expected, the flow profile between the adjacent slippery\nbroad faces is flat, however the profile between the narrow, sticky faces\nexhibits a curved velocity profile that is dependent on gas flow rate. We are\nable to analyze a 2d velocity profile from a 3d bulk system. We employ particle\nimage velocimetry to measure the strain rate, and compute the stress from the\npressure drop along the channel, to investigate the local stress-strain\nrelationships in a flowing foam. We find these dry foams to have a\nHershel-Bulkley exponent of 0.21, which is significantly lower (more shear\nthinning) than other results shown in the literature for much wetter foams.\n"

S'  We present nonlinear dielectric measurements of glass-forming 1-propanol, a\nprototypical example for the monohydroxy alcohols that are known to exhibit\nunusual relaxation dynamics, namely an additional Debye relaxation, slower than\nthe structural alpha relaxation. Applying high ac fields of 468 kV/cm allows\nfor a detailed investigation of the nonlinear properties of all three\nrelaxation processes occurring in 1-propanol, namely the Debye, alpha, and beta\nrelaxation. Both the field-induced variations of dielectric constant and loss\nare reported. Polarization saturation and the absorption of field energy govern\nthe findings in the Debye-relaxation regime, well consistent with the suggested\ncluster-like nature of the relaxing entities. The behavior of the alpha\nrelaxation is in good accord with the expectations for a heterogeneous\nrelaxation scenario. Finally, the Johari-Goldstein beta-relaxation in\n1-propanol seems to exhibit no or only weak field dependence, in agreement with\nrecent findings for the excess wing of canonical glass formers.\n'

S'  We discuss methodological issues related to the evaluation of unsupervised\nbinary code construction methods for nearest neighbor search. These issues have\nbeen widely ignored in literature. These coding methods attempt to preserve\neither Euclidean distance or angular (cosine) distance in the binary embedding\nspace. We explain why when comparing a method whose goal is preserving cosine\nsimilarity to one designed for preserving Euclidean distance, the original\nfeatures should be normalized by mapping them to the unit hypersphere before\nlearning the binary mapping functions. To compare a method whose goal is to\npreserves Euclidean distance to one that preserves cosine similarity, the\noriginal feature data must be mapped to a higher dimension by including a bias\nterm in binary mapping functions. These conditions ensure the fair comparison\nbetween different binary code methods for the task of nearest neighbor search.\nOur experiments show under these conditions the very simple methods (e.g. LSH\nand ITQ) often outperform recent state-of-the-art methods (e.g. MDSH and\nOK-means).\n'

S'  We report low temperature scanning tunneling microscopy characterization of\nMoSe2 crystals, and the fabrication and electrical characterization of MoSe2\nfield-effect transistors on both SiO2 and parylene-C substrates. We find that\nthe multilayer MoSe2 devices on parylene-C show a room temperature mobility\nclose to the mobility of bulk MoSe2 (100 cm2V-1s-1 - 160 cm2V-1s-1), which is\nsignificantly higher than that on SiO2 substrate (~50 cm2V-1s-1). The room\ntemperature mobility on both types of substrates are nearly thickness\nindependent. Our variable temperature transport measurements reveal a\nmetal-insulator transition at a characteristic conductivity of e2/h. The\nmobility of MoSe2 devices extracted from the metallic region on both SiO2 and\nparylene-C increases up to ~ 500 cm2V-1s-1 as the temperature decreases to ~\n100 K, with the mobility of MoSe2 on SiO2 increasing more rapidly. In spite of\nthe notable variation of charged impurities as indicated by the strongly sample\ndependent low temperature mobility, the mobility of all MoSe2 devices on SiO2\nconverges above 200 K, indicating that the high temperature (> 200 K) mobility\nin these devices is nearly independent of the charged impurities. Our atomic\nforce microscopy study of SiO2 and parylene-C substrates further rule out the\nsurface roughness scattering as a major cause of the substrate dependent\nmobility. We attribute the observed substrate dependence of MoSe2 mobility\nprimarily to the surface polar optical phonon scattering originating from the\nSiO2 substrate, which is nearly absent in MoSe2 devices on parylene-C\nsubstrate.\n'

S"  The supercooled liquid silicon, modeled by Stillinger-Weber potential, shows\nanomalous increase in heat capacity $C_p$, with a maximum $C_p$ value close to\n1060 K at zero pressure. We study equilibration and relaxation of the\nsupercooled SW Si, in the temperature range of 1060 K--1070 K at zero pressure.\nWe find that as the relaxation of the metastable supercooled liquid phase\ninitiates, a straight line region (SLR) is formed in cumulative potential\nenergy distributions. The configurational temperature corresponding to the SLR\nis close to 1060 K, which was earlier identified as the freezing temperature of\n4-coordinated amorphous network. The SLR is found to be tangential to the\ndistribution of the metastable liquid phase and thus influences the broadness\nof the distribution. As the bath temperature is reduced from 1070 K to 1060 K,\nthe effective temperature approaches the bath temperature which results in\nbroadening of the metastable phase distribution. This, in turn, causes an\nincrease in overall fluctuations of potential energy and hence an increase of\nheat capacity. We also find that during initial stages of relaxation,\n4-coordinated atoms form 6-membered rings with a chair--like structure and\nother structural units that indicate crystallization. Simultaneously a strong\ncorrelation is established between the number of chair-shaped 6-membered rings\nand the number of 4-coordinated atoms in the system. This shows that all\nproperties related to 4-coordinated particles are highly correlated as the SLR\nis formed in potential energy distributions and this can be interpreted as a\nconsequence of `freezing' of amorphous network formed by 4-coordinated\nparticles.\n"

S'  Network infrastructures are essential for the distribution of resources such\nas electricity and water. Typical strategies to assess their resilience focus\non the impact of a sequence of random or targeted failures of network nodes or\nlinks. Here we consider a more realistic scenario, where elements fail based on\ntheir usage. We propose a dynamic model of transport based on the\nBak-Tang-Wiesenfeld sandpile model where links fail after they have transported\nmore than an amount $\\mu$ (threshold) of the resource and we investigate it on\nthe square lattice. We observe that for low values of the threshold due to a\npositive feedback of link failure, an avalanche develops that leads to an\nabrupt collapse of the lattice. By contrast, for high thresholds the lattice\nbreaks down in an uncorrelated fashion. We determine the critical threshold\n$\\mu^*$ separating these two regimes and show how the time of the abrupt\ncollapse scales with lattice size and threshold $\\mu$. Furthermore, we propose\na lower bound for $\\mu^*$ by measuring the strength of the dynamics leading to\nabrupt collapses.\n'

S'  Several explanations can be found in the literature on how colorectal cancer\nbegins. There is however some agreement on the fact that its carcinogenic\nprocess is a result of several genetic mutations of normal cells. The colon\nepithelium is characterized by millions of invaginations, very small cavities,\ncalled crypts, where most of the cellular activity occurs. It is consensual in\nthe medical community, that a potential first manifestation of the carcinogenic\nprocess, observed in colonoscopy, is the appearance of Aberrant Crypt Foci\n(ACF). These are clusters of abnormal crypts, whose morphological\ncharacteristics are a consequence of an atypical behavior of the cells that\npopulate the crypts. In this work an homogenization model is proposed, for\nrepresenting the cellular dynamics in the colon epithelium, with the intention\nof simulating and predicting, {\\it in silico}, the spread and evolution of ACF,\nas it can be observed in colonoscopy. By assuming that the colon is an\nheterogeneous media, exhibiting a periodic distribution of very small cavities\n(the crypts), we first describe a periodic model that we have introduced\nrecently, for describing the ACF cell-dynamics in a two-dimensional setting.\nThen, to this periodic model, homogenization techniques are applied, to find a\nsimpler model, whose solution symbolizes the averaged behavior of ACF. Some\ntheoretical results concerning the existence of solution of the homogenized\nmodel are proven, applying a fixed point theorem. Numerical results showing the\nconvergence of the periodic model to the homogenized one are also presented.\n'

The stationary probability\ndistributions can be derived from a simple diffusion equation in the presence\nof an inhomogeneous effective temperature resulting from the action of external\nforce fields. In particular, transitions rates over asymmetric energy barriers\ncan be unbalanced by having two different effective temperatures over the two\nslopes of the barrier. By varying the type of active noise, we find that equal\nvalues of diffusivity and persistence time may produce strongly varied\neffective temperatures and thus stationary distributions.\n'

S'  Complex networks grow subject to structural constraints which affect their\nmeasurable properties. Assessing the effect that such constraints impose on\ntheir observables is thus a crucial aspect to be taken into account in their\nanalysis. To this end,we examine the effect of fixing the strength sequence in\nmulti-edge networks on several network observables such as degrees, disparity,\naverage neighbor properties and weight distribution using an ensemble approach.\nWe provide a general method to calculate any desired weighted network metric\nand we show that several features detected in real data could be explained\nsolely by structural constraints. We thus justify the need of analytical null\nmodels to be used as basis to assess the relevance of features found in real\ndata represented in weighted network form.\n'

S'  The Barab\\\'asi-Bianconi (BB) fitness model can be solved by a mapping between\nthe original network growth model to an idealized bosonic gas. The well-known\ntransition to Bose-Einstein condensation in the latter then corresponds to the\nemergence of "super-hubs" in the network model. Motivated by the preservation\nof the scale-free property, thermodynamic stability and self-duality, we\ngeneralize the original extensive mapping of the BB fitness model by using the\nnonextensive Kaniadakis k-distribution. Through numerical simulation and\nmean-field calculations we show that deviations from extensivity do not\ncompromise qualitative features of the phase transition. Analysis of the\ncritical temperature yields a monotonically decreasing dependence on the\nnonextensive parameter k.\n'

S"  Social media has been considered as a data source for tracking disease.\nHowever, most analyses are based on models that prioritize strong correlation\nwith population-level disease rates over determining whether or not specific\nindividual users are actually sick. Taking a different approach, we develop a\nnovel system for social-media based disease detection at the individual level\nusing a sample of professionally diagnosed individuals. Specifically, we\ndevelop a system for making an accurate influenza diagnosis based on an\nindividual's publicly available Twitter data. We find that about half (17/35 =\n48.57%) of the users in our sample that were sick explicitly discuss their\ndisease on Twitter. By developing a meta classifier that combines text\nanalysis, anomaly detection, and social network analysis, we are able to\ndiagnose an individual with greater than 99% accuracy even if she does not\ndiscuss her health.\n"

S'  This paper addresses the problem of identifying a very small subset of data\npoints that belong to a significantly larger massive dataset (i.e., Big Data).\nThe small number of selected data points must adequately represent and\nfaithfully characterize the massive Big Data. Such identification process is\nknown as representative selection [19]. We propose a novel representative\nselection framework by generating an l1 norm sparse graph for a given Big-Data\ndataset. The Big Data is partitioned recursively into clusters using a spectral\nclustering algorithm on the generated sparse graph. We consider each cluster as\none point in a Grassmann manifold, and measure the geodesic distance among\nthese points. The distances are further analyzed using a min-max algorithm [1]\nto extract an optimal subset of clusters. Finally, by considering a sparse\nsubgraph of each selected cluster, we detect a representative using principal\ncomponent centrality [11]. We refer to the proposed representative selection\nframework as a Sparse Graph and Grassmann Manifold (SGGM) based approach. To\nvalidate the proposed SGGM framework, we apply it onto the problem of video\nsummarization where only few video frames, known as key frames, are selected\namong a much longer video sequence. A comparison of the results obtained by the\nproposed algorithm with the ground truth, which is agreed by multiple human\njudges, and with some state-of-the-art methods clearly indicates the viability\nof the SGGM framework.\n'

S'  Analysis of high dimensional noisy data is of essence across a variety of\nresearch fields. Feature selection techniques are designed to find the relevant\nfeature subset that can facilitate classification or pattern detection.\nTraditional (supervised) feature selection methods utilize label information to\nguide the identification of relevant feature subsets. In this paper, however,\nwe consider the unsupervised feature selection problem. Without the label\ninformation, it is particularly difficult to identify a small set of relevant\nfeatures due to the noisy nature of real-world data which corrupts the\nintrinsic structure of the data. Our Gradient-based Laplacian Feature Selection\n(GLFS) selects important features by minimizing the variance of the Laplacian\nregularized least squares regression model. With $\\ell_1$ relaxation, GLFS can\nfind a sparse subset of features that is relevant to the Laplacian manifolds.\nExtensive experiments on simulated, three real-world object recognition and two\ncomputational biology datasets, have illustrated the power and superior\nperformance of our approach over multiple state-of-the-art unsupervised feature\nselection methods. Additionally, we show that GLFS selects a sparser set of\nmore relevant features in a supervised setting outperforming the popular\nelastic net methodology.\n'

S'  We study records generated by Brownian particles in one dimension.\nSpecifically, we investigate an ordinary random walk and define the record as\nthe maximal position of the walk. We compare the record of an individual random\nwalk with the mean record, obtained as an average over infinitely many\nrealizations. We term the walk "superior" if the record is always above\naverage, and conversely, the walk is said to be "inferior" if the record is\nalways below average. We find that the fraction of superior walks, S, decays\nalgebraically with time, S ~ t^(-beta), in the limit t --> infty, and that the\npersistence exponent is nontrivial, beta=0.382258.... The fraction of inferior\nwalks, I, also decays as a power law, I ~ t^(-alpha), but the persistence\nexponent is smaller, alpha=0.241608.... Both exponents are roots of\ntranscendental equations involving the parabolic cylinder function. To obtain\nthese theoretical results, we analyze the joint density of superior walks with\ngiven record and position, while for inferior walks it suffices to study the\ndensity as function of position.\n'

S'  Ordinary differential equations (ODEs) are used to model dynamic systems\nappearing in engineering, physics, biomedical sciences and many other fields.\nThese equations contain unknown parameters, say $\\theta$ of physical\nsignificance which have to be estimated from the noisy data. Often there is no\nclosed form analytic solution of the equations and hence we cannot use the\nusual non-linear least squares technique to estimate the unknown parameters.\nThere is a two step approach to solve this problem, where the first step\ninvolves fitting the data nonparametrically. In the second step the parameter\nis estimated by minimizing the distance between the nonparametrically estimated\nderivative and the derivative suggested by the system of ODEs. The statistical\naspects of this approach have been studied under the frequentist framework. We\nconsider this two step estimation under the Bayesian framework. The response\nvariable is allowed to be multidimensional and the true mean function of it is\nnot assumed to be in the model. We induce a prior on the regression function\nusing a random series based on the B-spline basis functions. We establish the\nBernstein-von Mises theorem for the posterior distribution of the parameter of\ninterest. Interestingly, even though the posterior distribution of the\nregression function based on splines converges at a rate slower than\n$n^{-1/2}$, the parameter vector $\\theta$ is nevertheless estimated at\n$n^{-1/2}$ rate.\n'

S'  Optomechanical systems provide a unique platform for observing quantum\nbehavior of macroscopic objects. However, efforts towards realizing nonlinear\nbehavior at the single photon level have been inhibited by the small size of\nthe radiation pressure interaction. Here we show that is possible to realize\nsignificant optomechanical nonlinearities at the few quanta level in a strongly\ndriven two-mode optomechanical system. In particular, as the strength of the\ndriving laser increases the energy of one of the optomechanical normal modes\napproaches zero and the associated harmonic oscillator length becomes large.\nThis leads to an enhanced single photon optomechanical coupling, scaling with\nthe sideband resolution of the mechanics. We show that this could be measured\nin two-photon correlations when the system is in the side-band resolved regime\nwith relatively large single-photon optomechanical coupling. These conditions\nare within the reach of current devices.\n'

S'  There has been great interest in two-dimensional materials, beyond graphene,\nfor both fundamental sciences and technological applications. Silicene, a\nsilicon counterpart of graphene, has been shown to possess some better\nelectronic properties than graphene. However, its thermal transport properties\nhave not been fully studied. In this paper, we apply the first-principles-based\nphonon Boltzmann transport equation formalism to investigate the thermal\nconductivity of silicene. Although both graphene and silicene are\ntwo-dimensional crystals with similar crystal structure, we find that phonon\ntransport in silicene is quite different from that in graphene. The thermal\nconductivity of silicene shows a logarithmic increase with respect to the\nsample size due to the small scattering rates of acoustic in-plane phonon\nmodes, while that of graphene is finite. Detailed analysis of phonon scattering\nchannels shows that the linear dispersion of the acoustic out-of-plane (ZA)\nphonon modes, which is induced by the buckled structure, makes the\nlong-wavelength longitudinal acoustic (LA) phonon modes in silicene not as\nefficiently scattered as that in graphene. Compared with graphene, where most\nof the heat is carried by the acoustic out-of-plane (ZA) phonon modes, the ZA\nphonon modes in silicene only have ~10% contribution to the total thermal\nconductivity, which can also be attributed to the buckled structure. This\nsystematic comparison of phonon transport and thermal conductivity using the\nfirst-principle-based calculations shed some light on other two-dimensional\nmaterials, such as two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides.\n'

DCA is a local continuous approach to solve a wide\nvariety of nonconvex programs for which it provided quite often a global\nsolution and proved to be more robust and efficient than standard methods.\nPreliminary comparative results of DCA and a classical Branch-and-Bound\nalgorithm will be presented.

Since in typical method the porogens are solved in the solution\nand flow with the polymers during the casting and the crystallinity behavior of\nPLA chains in the limited space cannot be tracked, in this work the processing\nis modified by diffusing the PLA solution into a steady salt stack. With a\nthermal treatment before leaching while maintaining the stable structure of the\nporogens stack, the crystallinity of porous foams is made possible to control.\nThe characterizations indicate the crystallization of porous foams is in a\nmanner of lower crystallibility than the bulk materials. Pores and caves of\naround 250{\\mu}m size are obtained in samples with different crystallinity. The\nmacro-structures are not much impaired by the crystallization nevertheless the\nmorphological effect of the heating process is still obvious.\n'

S'  Quantum electro-mechanical systems offer a unique opportunity to probe\nquantum noise properties in macroscopic devices, properties which ultimately\nstem from the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. A simple example of this is\nexpected to occur in a microwave parametric transducer, where mechanical motion\ngenerates motional sidebands corresponding to the up and down\nfrequency-conversion of microwave photons. Due to quantum vacuum noise, the\nrates of these processes are expected to be unequal. We measure this\nfundamental imbalance in a microwave transducer coupled to a radio-frequency\nmechanical mode, cooled near the ground state of motion. We also discuss the\nsubtle origin of this imbalance: depending on the measurement scheme, the\nimbalance is most naturally attributed to the quantum fluctuations of either\nthe mechanical mode or of the electromagnetic field.\n'

The formalism combines Floquet\ntheory with a generalized master equation approach. For a driven two-level\nsystem and in the long-time limit, we obtain a universal expression for the\ndistribution, providing clear physical insight into the exchanged energy\nquanta. We illustrate our approach in two analytically solvable cases and\ndiscuss the differences in the corresponding distributions.

The\nstudy of the dynamics of supercooled liquids with this type of quenched\ndisorder has drawn a lot of attention in recent years due to theoretical\npredictions of the possibility of observing the ideal thermodynamic glass\ntransition in such systems. In this Letter, we numerically examine this\npossibility by determining the phase diagram of the systems in the\n$\\rho_{pin}-T$ plane. We find that the phase diagram differs considerably from\nexisting theoretical predictions and show that a rapid decrease in the kinetic\nfragility of the system with increasing pin concentration is a probable reason\nfor this difference.\n'

S'  In this work, we propose a very simple deep learning network for image\nclassification which comprises only the very basic data processing components:\ncascaded principal component analysis (PCA), binary hashing, and block-wise\nhistograms. In the proposed architecture, PCA is employed to learn multistage\nfilter banks. It is followed by simple binary hashing and block histograms for\nindexing and pooling. This architecture is thus named as a PCA network (PCANet)\nand can be designed and learned extremely easily and efficiently. For\ncomparison and better understanding, we also introduce and study two simple\nvariations to the PCANet, namely the RandNet and LDANet. They share the same\ntopology of PCANet but their cascaded filters are either selected randomly or\nlearned from LDA. We have tested these basic networks extensively on many\nbenchmark visual datasets for different tasks, such as LFW for face\nverification, MultiPIE, Extended Yale B, AR, FERET datasets for face\nrecognition, as well as MNIST for hand-written digits recognition.\nSurprisingly, for all tasks, such a seemingly naive PCANet model is on par with\nthe state of the art features, either prefixed, highly hand-crafted or\ncarefully learned (by DNNs). Even more surprisingly, it sets new records for\nmany classification tasks in Extended Yale B, AR, FERET datasets, and MNIST\nvariations. Additional experiments on other public datasets also demonstrate\nthe potential of the PCANet serving as a simple but highly competitive baseline\nfor texture classification and object recognition.\n'

S'  Learning to rank is a supervised learning problem where the output space is\nthe space of rankings but the supervision space is the space of relevance\nscores. We make theoretical contributions to the learning to rank problem both\nin the online and batch settings. First, we propose a perceptron-like algorithm\nfor learning a ranking function in an online setting. Our algorithm is an\nextension of the classic perceptron algorithm for the classification problem.\nSecond, in the setting of batch learning, we introduce a sufficient condition\nfor convex ranking surrogates to ensure a generalization bound that is\nindependent of number of objects per query. Our bound holds when linear ranking\nfunctions are used: a common practice in many learning to rank algorithms. En\nroute to developing the online algorithm and generalization bound, we propose a\nnovel family of listwise large margin ranking surrogates. Our novel surrogate\nfamily is obtained by modifying a well-known pairwise large margin ranking\nsurrogate and is distinct from the listwise large margin surrogates developed\nusing the structured prediction framework. Using the proposed family, we\nprovide a guaranteed upper bound on the cumulative NDCG (or MAP) induced loss\nunder the perceptron-like algorithm. We also show that the novel surrogates\nsatisfy the generalization bound condition.\n'

S'  Understanding the spin-texture behavior of boundary modes in ultrathin\ntopological insulator films is critically essential for the design and\nfabrication of functional nano-devices. Here by using spin-resolved\nphotoemission spectroscopy with p-polarized light in topological insulator\nBi2Se3 thin films, we report tunneling-dependent evolution of spin\nconfiguration in topological insulator thin films across the metal-to-insulator\ntransition. We observe strongly binding energy- and wavevector-dependent spin\npolarization for the topological surface electrons in the ultra-thin\ngapped-Dirac-cone limit. The polarization decreases significantly with enhanced\ntunneling realized systematically in thin insulating films, whereas magnitude\nof the polarization saturates to the bulk limit faster at larger wavevectors in\nthicker metallic films. We present a theoretical model which captures this\ndelicate relationship between quantum tunneling and Fermi surface spin\npolarization. Our high-resolution spin-based spectroscopic results suggest that\nthe polarization current can be tuned to zero in thin insulating films forming\nthe basis for a future spin-switch nano-device.\n'

S"  Calculating portions of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of matrices or matrix\npencils has many applications. An approach to this calculation for Hermitian\nproblems based on a density matrix has been proposed in 2009 and a software\npackage called FEAST has been developed. The density-matrix approach allows\nFEAST's implementation to exploit a key strength of modern computer\narchitectures, namely, multiple levels of parallelism. Consequently, the\nsoftware package has been well received and subsequently commercialized. A\ndetailed theoretical analysis of Hermitian FEAST has also been established very\nrecently. This paper generalizes the FEAST algorithm and theory, for the first\ntime, to tackle non-Hermitian problems. Fundamentally, the new algorithm is\nbasic subspace iteration or Bauer bi-iteration, except applied with a novel\naccelerator based on Cauchy integrals. The resulting algorithm retains the\nmulti-level parallelism of Hermitian FEAST, making it a valuable new tool for\nlarge-scale computational science and engineering problems on leading-edge\ncomputing platforms.\n"

Here I address this question by\nintroducing a simple model of flow through a network with randomly-placed\n``congestible" and ``incongestible" links.

S'  In a previous study, we have discovered that nonlinear processes can be\nenhanced several orders of magnitude due to the path interference effects which\nare introduced by Fano resonances. Emergence of this phenomenon has been\ndemonstrated also in 3-dimensional solutions of Maxwell equations. However,\nenhancement has been found to be limited by the decay rate of the plasmonic\noscillations. In the present work, we demonstrate that such a limitation can be\nlifted o? when the path interference from two quantum emitters to a plasmonic\nresonator (second harmonic converter) is considered. Enhancement factors much\nlarger than 7 orders of magnitude are possible using such an interference\nscheme. Therefore, a single hybridized system of 3 particles (manufactured\ncarefully) can account for almost all of the second harmonic generated\nradiation emitted from a sample of plasmonic particle clusters decorated with\nquantum emitters (e.g. a spaser).\n'

Among these,\nsemiconductor QDs offer distinctive capabilities including on-demand operation,\ncoherent control, frequency tuning and compatibility with semiconductor\nnanotechnology. Moreover, the coherence of QD photons can be significantly\nenhanced in resonance fluorescence(RF) approaching at its best the coherence of\nthe excitation laser. However, the implementation of QD RF in scalable on-chip\ngeometries remains challenging due to the need to suppress stray laser photons.\nHere we report on-chip QD RF coupled into a single-mode waveguide with\nnegligible resonant laser background and show that the coherence is enhanced\ncompared to off-resonant excitation. The results pave the way to a novel class\nof integrated quantum-optical devices for on-chip QIP with embedded\nresonantly-driven quantum emitters.\n'

Super-efficiency DEA is employed to\nevaluate and rank features via their conditional dependence scores on all class\nlabels, and the feature with maximum super-efficiency score is then added in\nthe conditioning set for conditional dependence estimation in the next\niteration, in such a way as to iteratively select features and get the final\nselected features. Eventually, experiments are conducted to evaluate the\neffectiveness of proposed method comparing with four state-of-the-art methods\nfrom the viewpoint of classification accuracy. Empirical results verify the\nfeasibility and the superiority of proposed feature selection method.\n'

S'  As high-throughput sequencers become standard equipment outside of sequencing\ncenters, there is an increasing need for efficient methods for pre-processing\nand primary analysis. While a vast literature proposes methods for HTS data\nanalysis, we argue that significant improvements can still be gained by\nexploiting expensive pre-processing steps which can be amortized with savings\nfrom later stages. We propose a method to accelerate and improve read mapping\nbased on an initial clustering of possibly billions of high-throughput\nsequencing reads, yielding clusters of high stringency and a high degree of\noverlap. This clustering improves on the state-of-the-art in running time for\nsmall datasets and, for the first time, makes clustering high-coverage human\nlibraries feasible. Given the efficiently computed clusters, only one\nrepresentative read from each cluster needs to be mapped using a traditional\nreadmapper such as BWA, instead of individually mapping all reads. On human\nreads, all processing steps, including clustering and mapping, only require\n11%-59% of the time for individually mapping all reads, achieving speed-ups for\nall readmappers, while minimally affecting mapping quality. This accelerates a\nhighly sensitive readmapper such as Stampy to be competitive with a fast\nreadmapper such as BWA on unclustered reads.\n'

S'  Causal calculus is a tool to express causal effects in the terms of\nobservational probability distributions. The application of causal calculus in\nthe non-parametric form requires only the knowledge of the causal structure.\nHowever, some kind of explicit modeling is needed when numeric estimates of the\ncausal effect are to be calculated. In this paper, the estimation of\ncomplicated nonlinear causal relationships from observational data is studied.\nIt is demonstrated that the estimation of causal effects does not necessarily\nrequire the causal model to be specified parametrically but it suffices to\nmodel directly the observational probability distributions. The conditions when\nthis approach produces valid estimates are discussed. Generalized additive\nmodels, random forests and neural networks are applied to the estimation of\ncausal effects in examples featuring the backdoor and the frontdoor adjustment.\n'

S'  DNA methylation plays a pivotal role in the genetic evolution of both\nembryonic and adult cells. For adult somatic cells, location and dynamics of\nmethylation has been very precisely pinned down with the 5-cytosine markers on\ncytosinephosphate- guanine (CpG) units. Unusual methylation on CpG islands are\nidentified as one of the prime causes for silencing the tumor suppressant\ngenes. Early detection of such methylation can diagnose the potentially harmful\noncogenic evolution of cells, and provide a promising guideline for cancer\nprevention. With this motivation, we propose a cytosine methylation detection\ntechnique.Our hypothesis is that electronic signatures of DNA acquired as a\nmolecule translocates through a nanopore, would be significantly different for\nmethylated and non-methylated bases. This difference in electronic fingerprints\nwould allow for reliable real-time differentiations of methylated DNA. We\ncalculate transport currents through a punctured graphene membrane while the\ncytosine and methylated cytosine translocate through the nanopore. We also\ncalculate the transport properties for uracil and cyanocytosine for comparison.\nOur calculations of transmission, current, and tunneling conductance show\ndistinct signatures in their spectrum for each molecular type. Thus, in this\nwork, we provide a theoretical analysis that points to a viability of our\nhypothesis.\n'

S'  The slowdown of optical pulses due to quantum-coherence effects is\ninvestigated theoretically for an "active material" consisting of InGaAs-based\ndouble quantum-dot molecules. These are designed to exhibit a long lived\ncoherence between two electronic levels, which is an essential part of a\nquantum coherence scheme that makes use of electromagnetically-induced\ntransparency effects to achieve group velocity slowdown. We apply a\nmany-particle approach based on realistic semiconductor parameters that allows\nus to calculate the quantum-dot material dynamics including microscopic carrier\nscattering and polarisation dephasing dynamics. The group-velocity reduction is\ncharacterized in the frequency domain by a quasi-equilibrium slow-down factor\nand in the time domain by the probe-pulse slowdown obtained from a calculation\nof the spatio-temporal material dynamics coupled to the propagating optical\nfield. The group-velocity slowdown in the quantum-dot molecule is shown to be\nsubstantially higher than what is achievable from similar transitions in\ntypical InGaAs-based single quantum dots. The dependences of slowdown and shape\nof the propagating probe pulses on lattice temperature and drive intensities\nare investigated.\n'

S'  We propose an algebraic combinatorial method for solving large sparse linear\nsystems of equations locally - that is, a method which can compute single\nevaluations of the signal without computing the whole signal. The method scales\nonly in the sparsity of the system and not in its size, and allows to provide\nerror estimates for any solution method. At the heart of our approach is the\nso-called regression matroid, a combinatorial object associated to sparsity\npatterns, which allows to replace inversion of the large matrix with the\ninversion of a kernel matrix that is constant size. We show that our method\nprovides the best linear unbiased estimator (BLUE) for this setting and the\nminimum variance unbiased estimator (MVUE) under Gaussian noise assumptions,\nand furthermore we show that the size of the kernel matrix which is to be\ninverted can be traded off with accuracy.\n'

S"  Fisher's exact test is often a preferred method to estimate the significance\nof statistical dependence. However, in large data sets the test is usually too\nworksome to be applied, especially in an exhaustive search (data mining). The\ntraditional solution is to approximate the significance with the\n$\\chi^2$-measure, but the accuracy is often unacceptable. As a solution, we\nintroduce a family of upper bounds, which are fast to calculate and approximate\nFisher's $p$-value accurately. In addition, the new approximations are not\nsensitive to the data size, distribution, or smallest expected counts like the\n$\\chi^2$-based approximation. According to both theoretical and experimental\nanalysis, the new approximations produce accurate results for all sufficiently\nstrong dependencies. The basic form of the approximation can fail with weak\ndependencies, but the general form of the upper bounds can be adjusted to be\narbitrarily accurate.\n"

S'  A skyrmion is a topological texture in the continuum field theory. Recent\nexperimental observation of skyrmions in chiral magnet evokes a flourish of its\nextensive study. Skyrmion is expected to be a key component of the next\ngeneration spintronics device called skyrmionics. On the other hand, there is a\nwell established memory device encoded by a sequence of domain walls. A\nskyrmion carries a topological number, whereas a domain wall does not.\nNevertheless, we show a conversion is possible between a skyrmion and a\ndomain-wall pair by connecting wide and narrow nanowires, enabling the\ninformation transmission between skyrmion device and domain-wall device. Our\nresults will be the basis of a hybrid device made of skyrmions and domain\nwalls, where the encoded information in domain walls is converted into\nskyrmions, and then read out by converting the skyrmions back to domain walls\nafter a functional control of the skyrmions.\n'

Second, by using this extension, we demonstrate optimal\nconvergence rates with respect to a modified approximation class defined\nthrough the total error, as is customary since the seminal work of Cascon,\nKreuzer, Nochetto and Siebert. Third, building on the tools developed in the\npapers of Binev, Dahmen, DeVore, and Petrushev, and of Gaspoz and Morin, we\nprove that the modified approximation class coincides with the standard\napproximation class (the latter defined through the energy error), modulo the\nassumption that the data is regular enough in an appropriate scale of Besov\nspaces.\n'

We\ncharacterize the critical strain, statistics of breaking versus making a\ncontact, and ratio of shear modulus before and after such events, and explain\ntheir finite size scaling relations. For large systems at finite pressure, the\ncritical strain vanishes but the ratio of shear modulus before and after a\ncontact change approaches one: linear response remains relevant in large\nsystems. For finite systems close to jamming the critical strain also vanishes,\nbut here linear response already breaks down after a single contact change.\n'

S'  The penalization method is used to take account of obstacles, such as the\nlimiter, in a tokamak. Because of the magnetic confinement of the plasma in a\ntokamak, the transport occurs essentially in the direction parallel to the\nmagnetic field lines. We study a 1D nonlinear hyperbolic system as a simplified\nmodel of the plasma transport in the area close to the wall. A penalization\nwhich cuts the flux term of the momentum is studied. We show numerically that\nthis penalization creates a Dirac measure at the plasma-limiter interface which\nprevents us from defining the transport term in the usual distribution sense.\nHence, a new penalty method is proposed for this hyperbolic system. For this\npenalty method, an asymptotic expansion and numerical tests give an optimal\nrate of convergence without spurious boundary layer. Another two-fields\npenalization has also been implemented and the numerical convergence analysis\nwhen the penalization parameter tends to $0$ reveals the presence of a boundary\nlayer.\n'

After the milling process, the\ncoercivity of the nanoparticles reached 3.75 kOe - a value almost five times\nhigher than that obtained for the non-milled sample. We performed a thermal\ntreatment on the milled sample at 300, 400, and 600 oC for 30 and 180 mins, and\nstudied the changes in the magnetic parameters due to the thermal treatment\nusing the hysteresis curves, Williamson-Hall analysis, and transmission\nelectron microscopy. The thermal treatment at 600 oC causes a decrease in the\nmicrostructural strain and density of structural defects resulting in a\nsignificant decrease in coercivity. Furthermore, this thermal treatment\nincreases the size of the nanoparticles and, as a consequence, there is a\nsubstantial increase in the saturation magnetization. The coercivity and the\nsaturation magnetization are less affected by the thermal treatment at 300 and\n400 oC.\n'

S'  The clustering ensemble technique aims to combine multiple clusterings into a\nprobably better and more robust clustering and has been receiving an increasing\nattention in recent years. There are mainly two aspects of limitations in the\nexisting clustering ensemble approaches. Firstly, many approaches lack the\nability to weight the base clusterings without access to the original data and\ncan be affected significantly by the low-quality, or even ill clusterings.\nSecondly, they generally focus on the instance level or cluster level in the\nensemble system and fail to integrate multi-granularity cues into a unified\nmodel. To address these two limitations, this paper proposes to solve the\nclustering ensemble problem via crowd agreement estimation and\nmulti-granularity link analysis. We present the normalized crowd agreement\nindex (NCAI) to evaluate the quality of base clusterings in an unsupervised\nmanner and thus weight the base clusterings in accordance with their clustering\nvalidity. To explore the relationship between clusters, the source aware\nconnected triple (SACT) similarity is introduced with regard to their common\nneighbors and the source reliability. Based on NCAI and multi-granularity\ninformation collected among base clusterings, clusters, and data instances, we\nfurther propose two novel consensus functions, termed weighted evidence\naccumulation clustering (WEAC) and graph partitioning with multi-granularity\nlink analysis (GP-MGLA) respectively. The experiments are conducted on eight\nreal-world datasets. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and\nrobustness of the proposed methods.\n'
