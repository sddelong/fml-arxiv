S'  We prove a structure theorem for multiplicative functions on the Gaussian\nintegers, showing that every bounded multiplicative function on the Gaussian\nintegers can be decomposed into a term which is approximately periodic and\nanother which has a small U^3-Gowers uniformity norm. We apply this to prove\npartition regularity results over the Gaussian integers for certain equations\ninvolving quadratic forms in three variables. For example, we show that for any\nfinite coloring of the Gaussian integers, there exists dfferent nonzero\nelements x and y of the same color such that x^2-y^2=n^2 for some Gaussian\ninteger n, the analog of which over Z remains open.\n'

S'  Localization and tracking of a mobile node (MN) in non-line-of-sight (NLOS)\nscenarios, based on time of arrival (TOA) measurements, is considered in this\nwork. To this end, we develop a constrained form of square root unscented\nKalman filter (SRUKF), where the sigma points of the unscented transformation\nare projected onto the feasible region by solving constrained optimization\nproblems. The feasible region is the intersection of several discs formed by\nthe NLOS measurements. We show how we can reduce the size of the optimization\nproblem and formulate it as a convex quadratically constrained quadratic\nprogram (QCQP), which depends on the Cholesky factor of the \\textit{a\nposteriori} error covariance matrix of SRUKF. As a result of these\nmodifications, the proposed constrained SRUKF (CSRUKF) is more efficient and\nhas better numerical stability compared to the constrained UKF. Through\nsimulations, we also show that the CSRUKF achieves a smaller localization error\ncompared to other techniques and that its performance is robust under different\nNLOS conditions.\n'

S"  In this article we review Tononi's (2008) theory of consciousness as\nintegrated information. We argue that previous formalizations of integrated\ninformation (e.g. Griffith, 2014) depend on information loss. Since lossy\nintegration would necessitate continuous damage to existing memories, we\npropose it is more natural to frame consciousness as a lossless integrative\nprocess and provide a formalization of this idea using algorithmic information\ntheory. We prove that complete lossless integration requires noncomputable\nfunctions. This result implies that if unitary consciousness exists, it cannot\nbe modelled computationally.\n"

S'  We study the uniqueness of minimal liftings of cut-generating functions\nobtained from maximal lattice-free polyhedra. We prove a basic invariance\nproperty of unique minimal liftings for general maximal lattice-free polyhedra.\nThis generalizes a previous result by Basu, Cornu\\\'ejols and K\\"oppe for {\\em\nsimplicial} maximal lattice-free polytopes, thus completely settling this\nfundamental question about lifting. We further give a very general iterative\nconstruction to get maximal lattice-free polyhedra with the unique-lifting\nproperty in arbitrary dimensions. This single construction not only obtains all\npreviously known polyhedra with the unique-lifting property, but goes further\nand vastly expands the known list of such polyhedra. Along the way, we develop\ntools which clarify topological properties of the space of maximal lattice-free\npolyhedra with unique-liftings which we believe to be of independent interest.\nFinally, we extend characterizations from the literature about lifting with\nrespect to maximal lattice-free simplices to more general polytopes. These\nnontrivial generalizations rely on a number of results theorems from discrete\ngeometry, including the Venkov-Alexandrov-McMullen theorem on translative\ntilings and characterizations of zonotopes in terms of central symmetry of\ntheir faces.\n'

S'  In this paper, we design and analyze distributed vector quantization (VQ) for\ncompressed measurements of correlated sparse sources over noisy channels.\nInspired by the framework of compressed sensing (CS) for acquiring compressed\nmeasurements of the sparse sources, we develop optimized quantization schemes\nthat enable distributed encoding and transmission of CS measurements over noisy\nchannels followed by joint decoding at a decoder. The optimality is addressed\nwith respect to minimizing the sum of mean-square error (MSE) distortions\nbetween the sparse sources and their reconstruction vectors at the decoder. We\npropose a VQ encoder-decoder design via an iterative algorithm, and derive a\nlower-bound on the end-to-end MSE of the studied distributed system. Through\nseveral simulation studies, we evaluate the performance of the proposed\ndistributed scheme.\n'

S'  Distributed voting is a fundamental topic in distributed computing. In pull\nvoting, in each step every vertex chooses a neighbour uniformly at random, and\nadopts its opinion. The voting is completed when all vertices hold the same\nopinion. On many graph classes including regular graphs, pull voting requires\n$\\Theta(n)$ expected steps to complete, even if initially there are only two\ndistinct opinions.\n  In this paper we consider a related process which we call two-sample voting:\nevery vertex chooses two random neighbours in each step. If the opinions of\nthese neighbours coincide, then the vertex revises its opinion according to the\nchosen sample. Otherwise, it keeps its own opinion. We consider the performance\nof this process in the case where two di?erent opinions reside on vertices of\nsome (arbitrary) sets $A$ and $B$, respectively. Here, $|A| + |B| = n$ is the\nnumber of vertices of the graph.\n  We show that there is a constant $K$ such that if the initial imbalance\nbetween the two opinions is ?$\\nu_0 = (|A| - |B|)/n \\geq K \\sqrt{(1/d) +\n(d/n)}$, then with high probability two sample voting completes in a random $d$\nregular graph in $O(\\log n)$ steps and the initial majority opinion wins. We\nalso show the same performance for any regular graph, if $\\nu_0 \\geq K\n\\lambda_2$ where $\\lambda_2$ is the second largest eigenvalue of the transition\nmatrix. In the graphs we consider, standard pull voting requires $\\Omega(n)$\nsteps, and the minority can still win with probability $|B|/n$.\n'

S'  In this paper, we propose to study four meteorological and seasonal time\nseries coupled with a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) modeling. We chose to\ncombine two transfer functions for the nodes of the hidden layer, and to use a\ntemporal indicator (time index as input) in order to take into account the\nseasonal aspect of the studied time series. The results of the prediction\nconcern two years of measurements and the learning step, eight independent\nyears. We show that this methodology can improve the accuracy of meteorological\ndata estimation compared to a classical MLP modelling with a homogenous\ntransfer function.\n'

S'  We consider a class of kinetically constrained interacting particle systems\non $Z^d$ which play a key role in several heuristic qualitative and\nquantitative approaches to describe the complex behavior of glassy dynamics.\nWith rate one and independently among the vertices of $Z^d$, to each occupation\nvariable $\\eta(x)$ a new value is proposed by tossing a (1-q)-coin. If a\ncertain local constraint is satisfied by the current configuration the proposed\nmove is accepted, otherwise it is rejected. For d=1 the constraint requires\nthat there is a vacancy at the vertex to the left of the updating vertex. In\nthis case the process is the well known East process. In two dimensions the\nWest or the South neighbor of the updating vertex must contain a vacancy.\nSimilarly in higher dimensions. Despite of their apparent simplicity, in the\nlimit of low vacancy density, corresponding to a low temperature physical\nsetting, these processes feature a rather complicated dynamic behavior with\nhierarchical relaxation time scales, heterogeneity and universality. Using\nrenormalization group ideas, we first show that the relaxation time in\nd-dimensions scales as the 1/d-root of the relaxation time of the East process,\nconfirming indications coming from massive numerical simulations. Next we\ncompute the relaxation time in finite boxes by carefully analyzing the subtle\nenergy-entropy competition, using a multi-scale analysis, capacity methods and\nan algorithmic construction. Our results establish dynamic heterogeneity and a\ndramatic dependence on the boundary conditions. Finally we prove a rather\nstrong anisotropy property of these processes: the creation of a new vacancy at\na vertex $x$ out of an isolated one at the origin (a seed) may occur on\n(logarithmically) different time scales which heavily depend not only on the\n$\\ell_1$-norm of $x$ but also on its direction.\n'

The\nprototype of our main results is the following: there exists a function\n$\\delta=\\delta(k,N) \\in \\mathbb{N}$, increasing in $k$, such that if\n$(u_1,\\dots,u_k)$ is a solution and \\[ u_1(x)+\\cdots+u_k(x) \\le C(1+|x|^d)\n\\qquad \\text{for every $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^N$}, \\] then $d \\ge \\delta$. This\nmeans that the number of components $k$ of the solution imposes an increasing\nin $k$ minimal growth on the solution itself. If $N=2$, the expression of\n$\\delta$ is explicit and optimal, while in higher dimension it can be\ncharacterized in terms of an optimal partition problem. We discuss the\nsharpness of our results and, as a further step, for every $N \\ge 2$ we can\nprove the $1$-dimensional symmetry of the solutions satisfying suitable\nassumptions, extending known results which are available for $k=2$. The proofs\nrest upon a blow-down analysis and on some monotonicity formulae.\n'

We present two\nresults concerning the parameterized complexity of the {\\sc Bandwidth} problem\non trees.\n  First we show that an algorithm for {\\sc Bandwidth} with running time\n$f(b)n^{o(b)}$ would violate the Exponential Time Hypothesis, even if the input\ngraphs are restricted to be trees of pathwidth at most two. Our lower bound\nshows that the classical $2^{O(b)}n^{b+1}$ time algorithm by Saxe [SIAM Journal\non Algebraic and Discrete Methods, 1980] is essentially optimal.\n  Our second result is a polynomial time algorithm that given a tree $T$ and\ninteger $b$, either correctly concludes that the bandwidth of $T$ is more than\n$b$ or finds a layout of $T$ of bandwidth at most $b^{O(b)}$. This is the first\nparameterized approximation algorithm for the bandwidth of trees.\n'

S"  The sum secure degrees of freedom (s.d.o.f.) of two fundamental multi-user\nnetwork structures, the K-user Gaussian multiple access (MAC) wiretap channel\nand the K-user interference channel (IC) with secrecy constraints, have been\ndetermined recently as K(K-1)/(K(K-1)+1) [1,2] and K(K-1)/(2K-1) [3,4],\nrespectively. In this paper, we determine the entire s.d.o.f. regions of these\ntwo channel models. The converse for the MAC follows from a middle step in the\nconverse of [1,2]. The converse for the IC includes constraints both due to\nsecrecy as well as due to interference. Although the portion of the region\nclose to the optimum sum s.d.o.f. point is governed by the upper bounds due to\nsecrecy constraints, the other portions of the region are governed by the upper\nbounds due to interference constraints. Different from the existing literature,\nin order to fully understand the characterization of the s.d.o.f. region of the\nIC, one has to study the 4-user case, i.e., the 2 or 3-user cases do not\nillustrate the generality of the problem. In order to prove the achievability,\nwe use the polytope structure of the converse region. In both MAC and IC cases,\nwe develop explicit schemes that achieve the extreme points of the polytope\nregion given by the converse. Specifically, the extreme points of the MAC\nregion are achieved by an m-user MAC wiretap channel with (K-m) helpers, i.e.,\nby setting (K-m) users' secure rates to zero and utilizing them as pure\n(structured) cooperative jammers. The extreme points of the IC region are\nachieved by a (K-m)-user IC with confidential messages, m helpers, and N\nexternal eavesdroppers, for m>=1 and a finite N. A byproduct of our results in\nthis paper is that the sum s.d.o.f. is achieved only at one extreme point of\nthe s.d.o.f. region, which is the symmetric-rate extreme point, for both MAC\nand IC channel models.\n"

S'  We consider a resource-limited scenario where a sensor that uses compressed\nsensing (CS) collects a low number of measurements in order to observe a sparse\nsignal, and the measurements are subsequently quantized at a low bit-rate\nfollowed by transmission or storage. For such a scenario, we design new\nalgorithms for source coding with the objective of achieving good\nreconstruction performance of the sparse signal. Our approach is based on an\nanalysis-by-synthesis principle at the encoder, consisting of two main steps:\n(1) the synthesis step uses a sparse signal reconstruction technique for\nmeasuring the direct effect of quantization of CS measurements on the final\nsparse signal reconstruction quality, and (2) the analysis step decides\nappropriate quantized values to maximize the final sparse signal reconstruction\nquality. Through simulations, we compare the performance of the proposed\nquantization algorithms vis-a-vis existing quantization schemes.\n'

S'  We are interested in almost global existence cases in the general theory for\nnonlinear wave equations, which are caused by critical exponents of nonlinear\nterms. Such situations can be found in only three cases in the theory, cubic\nterms in two space dimensions, quadratic terms in three space dimesions and\nquadratic terms including a square of unknown functions itself in four space\ndimensions. Except for the last case, criterions to classify nonlinear terms\ninto the almost global, or global existence case, are well-studied and known to\nbe so-called null condition and non-positive condition.\n  Our motivation of this work is to find such a kind of the criterion in four\nspace dimensions. In our previous paper, an example of the non-single term for\nthe almost global existence case is introduced. In this paper, we show an\nexample of the global existence case. These two examples have nonlinear\nintegral terms which are closely related to derivative loss due to high\ndimensions. But it may help us to describe the final form of the criterion.\n'

S"  The inverse theorem for the Gowers norms, in the form proved by Green, Tao\nand Ziegler, applies to functions on an interval $[M]$. A recent paper of\nCandela and Sisask requires a stronger conclusion when applied to $N$-periodic\nfunctions; specifically, that the corresponding nilsequence should also be\n$N$-periodic in a strong sense.\n  In most cases, this result is implied by work of Szegedy (and Camarena and\nSzegedy) on the inverse theorem. This deduction is given in Candela and\nSisask's paper. Here, we give an alternative proof, which uses only the\nGreen--Tao--Ziegler inverse theorem as a black box. The result is also\nmarginally stronger, removing a technical condition from the statement.\n  The proof centers around a general construction in the category of\nnilsequences and nilmanifolds, which is possibly of some independent interest.\n"

S'  The existence of global-in-time classical solutions to the Cauchy problem of\nincompressible Magnetohydrodynamic flows with zero magnetic diffusivity is\nconsidered in two dimensions. The linearization of equations is a degenerated\nparabolic-hyperbolic system. The solution is constructed as a small\nperturbation of a constant background in critical spaces. The deformation\ngradient has been introduced to decouple the subtle coupling between the flow\nand the magnetic field. The $L^1$ dissipation of the velocity is obtained.\n'

S'  For a networked control system, we consider the problem of encoder and\ncontroller design. We study a discrete-time linear plant with a finite horizon\nperformance cost, comprising of a quadratic function of the states and\ncontrols, and an additive communication cost. We study separation in design of\nthe encoder and controller, along with related closed-loop properties such as\nthe dual effect and certainty equivalence. We consider three basic formats for\nencoder outputs: quantized samples, real-valued samples at event-triggered\ntimes, and real-valued samples over additive noise channels. If the controller\nand encoder are dynamic, then we show that the performance cost is minimized by\na separated design: the controls are updated at each time instant as per a\ncertainty equivalence law, and the encoder is chosen to minimize an aggregate\nquadratic distortion of the estimation error. This separation is shown to hold\neven though a dual effect is present in the closed-loop system. We also show\nthat this separated design need not be optimal when the controller or encoder\nare to be chosen from within restricted classes.\n'

Here we undertake the calculation of this\nleading coefficient in a different way. Firstly, we tridiagonalize the GUE\nmatrix in the manner of Trotter and Dumitriu-Edelman and then alter it by\nconjugation to make the subdiagonal identically equal to $1$. Secondly, we\napply the cluster expansion technique (specifically, the\nBrydges-Kennedy-Abdesselam-Rivasseau formula) from rigorous statistical\nmechanics. Thirdly, by sorting through the terms of the expansion thus\ngenerated we arrive at an alternate interpretation for the leading coefficient\nrelated to factorizations of the long cycle $(12\\cdots n)\\in S_n$. Finally, we\nreconcile the group-theoretical objects emerging from our calculation with the\nlabeled mobiles of Bouttier-Di Francesco-Guitter.\n'

S'  Fully dynamic graph is a data structure that (1) supports edge insertions and\ndeletions and (2) answers problem specific queries. The time complexity of (1)\nand (2) are referred to as the update time and the query time respectively.\nThere are many researches on dynamic graphs whose update time and query time\nare $o(|G|)$, that is, sublinear in the graph size. However, almost all such\nresearches are for problems in P. In this paper, we investigate dynamic graphs\nfor NP-hard problems exploiting the notion of fixed parameter tractability\n(FPT).\n  We give dynamic graphs for Vertex Cover and Cluster Vertex Deletion\nparameterized by the solution size $k$. These dynamic graphs achieve almost the\nbest possible update time $O(\\mathrm{poly}(k)\\log n)$ and the query time\n$O(f(\\mathrm{poly}(k),k))$, where $f(n,k)$ is the time complexity of any static\ngraph algorithm for the problems. We obtain these results by dynamically\nmaintaining an approximate solution which can be used to construct a small\nproblem kernel. Exploiting the dynamic graph for Cluster Vertex Deletion, as a\ncorollary, we obtain a quasilinear-time (polynomial) kernelization algorithm\nfor Cluster Vertex Deletion. Until now, only quadratic time kernelization\nalgorithms are known for this problem.\n  We also give a dynamic graph for Chromatic Number parameterized by the\nsolution size of Cluster Vertex Deletion, and a dynamic graph for\nbounded-degree Feedback Vertex Set parameterized by the solution size. Assuming\nthe parameter is a constant, each dynamic graph can be updated in $O(\\log n)$\ntime and can compute a solution in $O(1)$ time. These results are obtained by\nanother approach.\n'

The sparseness of\nthe spanner can be measured by its size (the number of edges) and weight (the\nsum of all edge weights), both being important measures of the spanner's\nquality -- in this work we focus on the latter.\n  Specifically, it is shown that for any parameters $k\\ge 1$ and $\\epsilon>0$,\nany weighted graph $G$ on $n$ vertices admits a\n$(2k-1)\\cdot(1+\\epsilon)$-stretch spanner of weight at most $w(MST(G))\\cdot\nO_\\epsilon(kn^{1/k}/\\log k)$, where $w(MST(G))$ is the weight of a minimum\nspanning tree of $G$.

S"  For each of the notions of hypergraph quasirandomness that have been studied,\nwe identify a large class of hypergraphs F so that every quasirandom hypergraph\nH admits a perfect F-packing. An informal statement of a special case of our\ngeneral result for 3-uniform hypergraphs is as follows. Fix an integer r >= 4\nand 0<p<1. Suppose that H is an n-vertex triple system with r|n and the\nfollowing two properties:\n  * for every graph G with V(G)=V(H), at least p proportion of the triangles in\nG are also edges of H,\n  * for every vertex x of H, the link graph of x is a quasirandom graph with\ndensity at least p.\n  Then H has a perfect $K_r^{(3)}$-packing. Moreover, we show that neither\nhypotheses above can be weakened, so in this sense our result is tight. A\nsimilar conclusion for this special case can be proved by Keevash's hypergraph\nblowup lemma, with a slightly stronger hypothesis on H.\n"

Later [Seb\\H{o},\nIPCO 2013] further improved the approximation factor to $\\frac{8}{5}$.

Also, we show\nthat the minimum-cost of integral solutions of the two LPs are within a factor\nof $\\frac{3}{2}$ of each other. We prove that a half-integral solution of the\nstronger LP-relaxation of cost $c$ can be rounded to an integral solution of\ncost at most $\\frac{3}{2}c$.

S'  We prove that well-known speed of light restrictions on electromagnetic\nenergy velocity can be extended to a new level of generality, encompassing even\nnonlocal chiral media in periodic geometries, while at the same time weakening\nthe underlying assumptions to only passivity and linearity of the medium\n(either with a transparency window or with dissipation). As was also shown by\nother authors under more limiting assumptions, passivity alone is sufficient to\nguarantee causality and positivity of the energy density (with no thermodynamic\nassumptions). Our proof is general enough to include a very broad range of\nmaterial properties, including anisotropy, bianisotropy (chirality),\nnonlocality, dispersion, periodicity, and even delta functions or similar\ngeneralized functions. We also show that the "dynamical energy density" used by\nsome previous authors in dissipative media reduces to the standard Brillouin\nformula for dispersive energy density in a transparency window. The results in\nthis paper are proved by exploiting deep results from linear-response theory,\nharmonic analysis, and functional analysis that had previously not been brought\ntogether in the context of electrodynamics.\n'

S'  A chordless cycle (induced cycle) $C$ of a graph is a cycle without any\nchord, meaning that there is no edge outside the cycle connecting two vertices\nof the cycle. A chordless path is defined similarly. In this paper, we consider\nthe problems of enumerating chordless cycles/paths of a given graph $G=(V,E),$\nand propose algorithms taking $O(|E|)$ time for each chordless cycle/path. In\nthe existing studies, the problems had not been deeply studied in the\ntheoretical computer science area, and no output polynomial time algorithm has\nbeen proposed. Our experiments showed that the computation time of our\nalgorithms is constant per chordless cycle/path for non-dense random graphs and\nreal-world graphs. They also show that the number of chordless cycles is much\nsmaller than the number of cycles. We applied the algorithm to prediction of\nNMR (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) spectra, and increased the accuracy of the\nprediction.\n'

Here, $F(y,x,M)$, $M\\in\\S$, is uniformly\nelliptic, where $\\S$ is the space of $n\\X n$ symmetric matrices, $F(y,x,\\cdot)$\nis concave (or convex), for each $(x,y)\\in\\bar\\Om\\X\\R^n$, and we also impose a\ntechnical condition of small oscillation on $F(\\cdot,x,M)$, throughout $\\R^n$,\nuniformly for $x\\in\\Om$ and $M\\in\\S$, with $\\|M\\|=1$. For each $x\\in\\bar\\Om, \\\nM\\in\\S$, we assume that the functions $F(\\cdot,x,M)$ and $f(\\cdot,x)$ are\nweakly almost periodic functions. The latter class of functions is an ergodic\nalgebra in $\\R^n$, which contains properly the algebra of almost periodic\nfunctions, as well as the algebra of Fourier-Stieltjes transforms. A similar\nresult, for fully nonlinear uniformly elliptic equations was known so far only\nin the case where $F(\\cdot,x, M ), f(\\cdot,x)$ are almost periodic functions,\nfor each $(x,M)\\in\\Om\\X\\S$, in which case we may drop both the concavity and\nsmall oscillation restrictions on $F(y,x,\\cdot)$ and $F(\\cdot,x,M)$,\nrespectively.

S'  We consider ensembles of channel codes that are partitioned into bins, and\nfocus on analysis of exact random coding error exponents associated with\noptimum decoding of the index of the bin to which the transmitted codeword\nbelongs. Two main conclusions arise from this analysis: (i) for independent\nrandom selection of codewords within a given type class, the random coding\nexponent of optimal bin index decoding is given by the ordinary random coding\nexponent function, computed at the rate of the entire code, independently of\nthe exponential rate of the size of the bin. (ii) for this ensemble of codes,\nsub-optimal bin index decoding, that is based on ordinary maximum likelihood\n(ML) decoding, is as good as the optimal bin index decoding in terms of the\nrandom coding error exponent achieved. Finally, for the sake of completeness,\nwe also outline how our analysis of exact random coding exponents extends to\nthe hierarchical ensemble that correspond to superposition coding and optimal\ndecoding, where for each bin, first, a cloud center is drawn at random, and\nthen the codewords of this bin are drawn conditionally independently given the\ncloud center. For this ensemble, conclusions (i) and (ii), mentioned above, no\nlonger hold necessarily in general.\n'

S'  As surrogate functions of $L_0$-norm, many nonconvex penalty functions have\nbeen proposed to enhance the sparse vector recovery. It is easy to extend these\nnonconvex penalty functions on singular values of a matrix to enhance low-rank\nmatrix recovery. However, different from convex optimization, solving the\nnonconvex low-rank minimization problem is much more challenging than the\nnonconvex sparse minimization problem. We observe that all the existing\nnonconvex penalty functions are concave and monotonically increasing on\n$[0,\\infty)$. Thus their gradients are decreasing functions. Based on this\nproperty, we propose an Iteratively Reweighted Nuclear Norm (IRNN) algorithm to\nsolve the nonconvex nonsmooth low-rank minimization problem. IRNN iteratively\nsolves a Weighted Singular Value Thresholding (WSVT) problem. By setting the\nweight vector as the gradient of the concave penalty function, the WSVT problem\nhas a closed form solution. In theory, we prove that IRNN decreases the\nobjective function value monotonically, and any limit point is a stationary\npoint. Extensive experiments on both synthetic data and real images demonstrate\nthat IRNN enhances the low-rank matrix recovery compared with state-of-the-art\nconvex algorithms.\n'

We establish a rigidity result for the\nEuler-Lagrange equation and deduce an estimate of the optimal constant in the\ninequality on two-dimensional closed Riemannian manifolds. Compared to existing\nresults, we provide a non-local criterion which is well adapted to variational\nmethods, introduce a nonlinear flow along which the evolution of a functional\nrelated with the inequality is monotone and get an integral remainder term\nwhich allows to discuss optimality issues. As an important application of our\nmethod, we also consider the non-compact case of the Moser-Trudinger-Onofri\ninequality on the two-dimensional Euclidean space, with weights. The standard\nweight is the one that is computed when projecting the two-dimensional sphere\nusing the stereographic projection, but we also give more general results which\nare of interest, for instance, for the Keller-Segel model in chemotaxis\n'

S'  We address the problem of testing whether a given dynamic graph is temporally\nconnected, {\\it i.e.} a temporal path (also called a {\\em journey}) exists\nbetween all pairs of vertices. We consider a discrete version of the problem,\nwhere the topology is given as an evolving graph\n$\\mathcal{G}=\\{G_1,G_2,...,G_{k}\\}$ whose set of vertices is invariant and the\nset of (directed) edges varies over time. Two cases are studied, depending on\nwhether a single edge or an unlimited number of edges can be crossed in a same\n$G_i$ (strict journeys {\\it vs} non-strict journeys).\n  In the case of strict journeys, two algorithms designed for other problems\ncan be adapted. However, we show that a dedicated approach performs better than\none of them in all cases, and than the other one for a large range of graphs,\nin particular those whose density is low at any time (though potentially high\nover time). The time complexity of our algorithm is $O(k\\mu n)$, where\n$k=|\\mathcal{G}|$ is the number of time steps $\\mathcal{G}$ covers and\n$\\mu=max(|E_i|)$ is the maximum {\\em instant} density, to be contrasted with\n$m=|\\cup E_i|$, the {\\em cumulated} density. Indeed, it is not uncommon for a\nmobility scenario to satisfy, for instance, both $\\mu=o(n)$ and\n$m=\\Theta(n^2)$. We characterize the key values of $k, \\mu$ and $m$ for which\nour algorithm should be used.\n  In the case of non-strict journeys, for which no algorithm is known, we show\nthat a similar strategy can be used to answer the question, still in $O(k\\mu\nn)$ time.\n  Both algorithms gradually build the transitive closure of strict journeys\n($\\mathcal{G}^*_{st}$) or non-strict journeys ($\\mathcal{G}^*$) as the edges\nare examined. A by-product of the execution is to make $\\mathcal{G}^*_{st}$ and\n$\\mathcal{G}^*$ available for further connectivity queries (in a temporal\nversion), these queries being then reduced to simple adjacency tests in a\nstatic graph.\n'

S'  Let $\\sigma$ be a partition of the positive integer $r$. A\n$\\sigma$-hypergraph $H=H(n,r,q|\\sigma)$ is an $r$-uniform hypergraph on $nq$\nvertices which are partitioned into $n$ classes $V_1, V_2, \\ldots, V_n$ each\ncontaining $q$ vertices. An $r$-subset $K$ of vertices is an edge of the\nhypergraph if the partition of $r$ formed by the non-zero cardinalities $|K\\cap\nV_i|, 1\\leq i \\leq n,$ is $\\sigma$.\n  In earlier works we have considered colourings of the vertices of $H$ which\nare constrained such that any edge has at least $\\alpha$ and at most $\\beta$\nvertices of the same colour, and we have shown that interesting results can be\nobtained by varying $\\alpha, \\beta$ and the parameters of $H$ appropriately. In\nthis paper we continue to investigate the versatility of $\\sigma$-hypergraphs\nby considering two classical problems: independence and matchings.\n  We first demonstrate an interesting link between the constrained colourings\ndescribed above and the $k$-independence number of a hypergraph, that is, the\nlargest cardinality of a subset of vertices of a hypergraph not containing\n$k+1$ vertices in the same edge. We also give an exact computation of the\n$k$-independence number of the $\\sigma$-hypergraph $H$. We then present results\non maximum, and sometimes perfect, matchings in $H$. These results often depend\non divisibility relations between the parameters of $H$ and on the highest\ncommon factor of the parts of $\\sigma$.\n'

In this paper, we\ninvestigate the identification of these non-linear parameter functions in a\nchemotaxis model with volume filling.

S"  In this paper we deal with the well-posedness of Dirichlet problems\nassociated to nonlocal Hamilton-Jacobi parabolic equations in a bounded, smooth\ndomain $\\Omega$, in the case when the classical boundary condition may be lost.\nWe address the problem for both coercive and noncoercive Hamiltonians: for\ncoercive Hamiltonians, our results rely more on the regularity properties of\nthe solutions, while noncoercive case are related to optimal control problems\nand the arguments are based on a careful study of the dynamics near the\nboundary of the domain. Comparison principles for bounded sub and\nsupersolutions are obtained in the context of viscosity solutions with\ngeneralized boundary conditions, and consequently we obtain the existence and\nuniqueness of solutions in $C(\\bar{\\Omega} \\times [0,+\\infty))$ by the\napplication of Perron's method.

S'  A space-time physical-layer network coding (ST-PNC) method is presented for\ninformation exchange among multiple users over fully-connected multi-way relay\nnetworks. The method involves two key steps: i) side-information learning and\nii) space-time relay transmission. In the first phase of side-information\nlearning, different sets of users are scheduled to send signals over networks\nand the remaining users and relays overhear the transmitted signals, thereby\nlearning the interference patterns. In the second phase of space-time relay\ntransmission, multiple relays cooperatively send out linear combinations of\nreceived signals in the previous phase using space-time precoding so that all\nusers efficiently exploit their side-information in the form of: 1) what they\nsent and 2) what they overheard in decoding. This coding concept is illustrated\nthrough two simple network examples, and it is shown that ST-PNC improves the\nsum of degrees of freedom (sum-DoF) of the network compared to existing\ninterference management methods. With ST-PNC, the sum-DoF of a general\nmulti-way relay network without channel knowledge at users is characterized in\nterms of relevant system parameters, chiefly the number of users, the number of\nrelays, and the number of antennas at relays. A major implication of the\nderived results is that efficiently harnessing both transmitted and overheard\nsignals as side-information brings significant performance improvements to\nfully-connected multi-way relay networks.\n'

The system of\nnonlinear partial differential equations can be formulated as variational\ninequality. The presence of the constraint in the evolution process leads to\nadditional terms in the equation and the boundary condition containing a\nsuitable Lagrange multiplier.

S"  Optical communication is well-suited to low probability of detection (LPD)\napplications. Several practical LPD systems exist that leverage the narrow beam\nspread at optical frequencies, and spread-spectrum modulation formats. We\nrecently proved that theoretically one can send $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{n})$ bits\nreliably and covertly over $n$ modes of a lossy optical channel with non-zero\nexcess noise present either in the channel or in the adversary's receiver when\nthe adversary Willie is assumed to be able to intercept all the light\ntransmitted by Alice not received by the intended receiver Bob. In this paper\nwe present the theory and implementation of optical LPD communication using a\npulse position modulation (PPM) alphabet and a Reed-Solomon outer code. We\nprove that, when the receiver and the adversary are both equipped with photon\ncounting receivers with non-zero dark count rates, Alice can reliably transmit\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{n}\\log Q)$ bits over a lossy channel using $n$ symbols of a\n$Q$-ary PPM constellation with essentially zero probability of detection by\nWillie, even if Willie can intercept all transmitted photons not received by\nBob. We corroborate our theoretical result with an experiment on an optical\ntestbed, which we believe is the first proof-of-concept demonstration of\ninformation-theoretically secure LPD communication.\n"

S'  As graphs continue to grow in size, we seek ways to effectively process such\ndata at scale. The model of streaming graph processing, in which a compact\nsummary is maintained as each edge insertion/deletion is observed, is an\nattractive one. However, few results are known for optimization problems over\nsuch dynamic graph streams.\n  In this paper, we introduce a new approach to handling graph streams, by\ninstead seeking solutions for the parameterized versions of these problems\nwhere we are given a parameter $k$ and the objective is to decide whether there\nis a solution bounded by $k$. By combining kernelization techniques with\nrandomized sketch structures, we obtain the first streaming algorithms for the\nparameterized versions of the Vertex Cover problem. We consider the following\nthree models for a graph stream on $n$ nodes:\n  1. The insertion-only model where the edges can only be added.\n  2. The dynamic model where edges can be both inserted and deleted.\n  3. The \\emph{promised} dynamic model where we are guaranteed that at each\ntimestamp there is a solution of size at most $k$.\n  In each of these three models we are able to design parameterized streaming\nalgorithms for the Vertex Cover problem. We are also able to show matching\nlower bound for the space complexity of our algorithms.\n  (Due to the arXiv limit of 1920 characters for abstract field, please see the\nabstract in the paper for detailed description of our results)\n'

S"  Stricker's theorem states that a Gaussian process is a semimartingale in its\nnatural filtration if and only if it is the sum of an independent increment\nGaussian process and a Gaussian process of finite variation, see [1983, Z.\nWahrsch. Verw. Gebiete 64(3)]. We consider extensions of this result to non\nGaussian infinitely divisible processes. First we show that the class of\ninfinitely divisible semimartingales is so large that the natural analog of\nStricker's theorem fails to hold. Then, as the main result, we prove that an\ninfinitely divisible semimartingale relative to the filtration generated by a\nrandom measure admits a unique decomposition into an independent increment\nprocess and an infinitely divisible process of finite variation. Consequently,\nthe natural analog of Stricker's theorem holds for all strictly representable\nprocesses (as defined in this paper). Since Gaussian processes are strictly\nrepresentable due to Hida's multiplicity theorem, the classical Stricker's\ntheorem follows from our result. Another consequence is that the question when\nan infinitely divisible process is a semimartingale can often be reduced to a\npath property, when a certain associated infinitely divisible process is of\nfinite variation. Along these lines, using Basse-O'Connor and Rosi\\'nski [2013,\nStochastic Process. Appl. 123(6)], we characterize semimartingales within a\nlarge class of stationary increment infinitely divisible processes; this class\nincludes many infinitely divisible processes of interest, including linear\nfractional processes, mixed moving averages, and supOU processes, as particular\ncases. The proof of the main theorem relies on series representations of jumps\nof c\\`adl\\`ag infinitely divisible processes given in Basse-O'Connor and\nRosi\\'nski [2013, Ann. Probab. 41(6)] combined with techniques of stochastic\nanalysis.\n"

We establish that\n$\\mathrm{aw}([n],3)=\\Theta(\\log n)$ and $\\mathrm{aw}([n],k)=n^{1-o(1)}$ for\n$k\\geq 4$.\n  For positive integers $n$ and $k$, the expression\n$\\mathrm{aw}(\\mathbb{Z}_n,k)$ denotes the smallest number of colors with which\nelements of the cyclic group of order $n$ can be colored and still guarantee\nthere is a rainbow arithmetic progression of length $k$. In this setting,\narithmetic progressions can "wrap around," and $\\mathrm{aw}(\\mathbb{Z}_n,3)$\nbehaves quite differently from $\\mathrm{aw}([n],3)$, depending on the\ndivisibility of $n$. In fact, $\\mathrm{aw}(\\mathbb{Z}_{2^m},3) = 3$ for any\npositive integer $m$. However, for $k\\geq 4$, the behavior is similar to the\nprevious case, that is, $\\mathrm{aw}(\\mathbb{Z}_n,k)=n^{1-o(1)}$.\n'

S"  Orbifolding two-dimensional quantum field theories by a symmetry group can\ninvolve a choice of discrete torsion. We apply the general formalism of\n`orbifolding defects' to study and elucidate discrete torsion for topological\nfield theories. In the case of Landau-Ginzburg models only the bulk sector had\nbeen studied previously, and we re-derive all known results. We also introduce\nthe notion of `projective matrix factorisations', show how they naturally\ndescribe boundary and defect sectors, and we further illustrate the efficiency\nof the defect-based approach by explicitly computing RR charges.\n  Roughly half of our results are not restricted to Landau-Ginzburg models but\nhold more generally, for any topological field theory. In particular we prove\nthat for a pivotal bicategory, any two objects of its orbifold completion that\nhave the same base are orbifold equivalent. Equivalently, from any orbifold\ntheory (including those based on nonabelian groups) the original unorbifolded\ntheory can be be obtained by orbifolding via the `quantum symmetry defect'.\n"

S"  In the past few years, a lot of attention has been devoted to multimedia\nindexing by fusing multimodal informations. Two kinds of fusion schemes are\ngenerally considered: The early fusion and the late fusion. We focus on late\nclassifier fusion, where one combines the scores of each modality at the\ndecision level. To tackle this problem, we investigate a recent and elegant\nwell-founded quadratic program named MinCq coming from the machine learning\nPAC-Bayesian theory. MinCq looks for the weighted combination, over a set of\nreal-valued functions seen as voters, leading to the lowest misclassification\nrate, while maximizing the voters' diversity. We propose an extension of MinCq\ntailored to multimedia indexing. Our method is based on an order-preserving\npairwise loss adapted to ranking that allows us to improve Mean Averaged\nPrecision measure while taking into account the diversity of the voters that we\nwant to fuse. We provide evidence that this method is naturally adapted to late\nfusion procedures and confirm the good behavior of our approach on the\nchallenging PASCAL VOC'07 benchmark.\n"

Motivated\nby statistical analysis, we assume that the service times are a mixture of a\nphase-type and a heavy-tailed distribution.

S'  Biomedical signals aid in the diagnosis of different disorders and\nabnormalities. When targeting lossy compression of such signals, the medically\nrelevant information that lies within the data should maintain its accuracy and\nthus its reliability. In fact, signal models that are inspired by the\nbio-physical properties of the signals at hand allow for a compression that\npreserves more naturally the clinically significant features of these signals.\nIn this paper, we illustrate this through the example of EEG signals; more\nspecifically, we analyze three specific lossy EEG compression schemes. These\nschemes are based on signal models that have different degrees of reliance on\nsignal production and physiological characteristics of EEG. The resilience of\nthese schemes is illustrated through the performance of seizure detection post\ncompression.\n'

It was shown by\nAdiga and Chandran (Journal of Graph Theory, 65(4), 2010) that for any graph\n$G$, $cub(G) \\le$ box$(G) \\left \\lceil \\log_2 \\alpha \\right \\rceil$, where\n$\\alpha = \\alpha(G)$ is the cardinality of the maximum independent set in $G$.\nIn this note we show that $cub(G) \\le 2 \\left \\lceil \\log_2 \\chi(G) \\right\n\\rceil box(G) + \\chi(G) \\left \\lceil \\log_2 \\alpha(G) \\right \\rceil $. In\ngeneral, this result can provide a much better upper bound than that of Adiga\nand Chandran for graph classes with bounded chromatic number. For example, for\nbipartite graphs we get, $cub(G) \\le 2 (box(G) + \\left \\lceil \\log_2 \\alpha(G)\n\\right \\rceil )$.\n  Moreover we show that for every positive integer $k$, there exist graphs with\nchromatic number $k$, such that for every $\\epsilon > 0$, the value given by\nour upper bound is at most $(1+\\epsilon)$ times their cubicity. Thus, our upper\nbound is almost tight.\n'

S'  Jumbled indexing is the problem of indexing a text $T$ for queries that ask\nwhether there is a substring of $T$ matching a pattern represented as a Parikh\nvector, i.e., the vector of frequency counts for each character. Jumbled\nindexing has garnered a lot of interest in the last four years. There is a\nnaive algorithm that preprocesses all answers in $O(n^2|\\Sigma|)$ time allowing\nquick queries afterwards, and there is another naive algorithm that requires no\npreprocessing but has $O(n\\log|\\Sigma|)$ query time. Despite a tremendous\namount of effort there has been little improvement over these running times.\n  In this paper we provide good reason for this. We show that, under a\n3SUM-hardness assumption, jumbled indexing for alphabets of size $\\omega(1)$\nrequires $\\Omega(n^{2-\\epsilon})$ preprocessing time or $\\Omega(n^{1-\\delta})$\nquery time for any $\\epsilon,\\delta>0$. In fact, under a stronger 3SUM-hardness\nassumption, for any constant alphabet size $r\\ge 3$ there exist describable\nfixed constant $\\epsilon_r$ and $\\delta_r$ such that jumbled indexing requires\n$\\Omega(n^{2-\\epsilon_r})$ preprocessing time or $\\Omega(n^{1-\\delta_r})$ query\ntime.\n'

S'  We study a bivariate mean reverting stochastic volatility model, finding an\nexplicit expression for the decay of cross-asset correlations over time. We\ncompare our result with the empirical time series of the Dow Jones Industrial\nAverage and the Financial Times Stock Exchange 100 in the period 1984-2013,\nfinding an excellent agreement. The main features of the model consist in the\njumps in the volatilities and a nonlinear mean reversion. Based on these\nfeatures, we propose an algorithm for the detection of jumps in the volatility.\n'

S'  We characterize the capacity region of the two-user Binary Fading\nInterference Channel where the transmitters have no knowledge of the channel\nstate information. We show that the entire capacity region is achieved by\napplying point-to-point erasure codes with appropriate rates at each\ntransmitter, and using either treat-interference-as-erasure or\ninterference-decoding at each receiver, based on the channel parameters. The\nresult is obtained by developing a novel outer-bound that has three main steps.\nWe first create a contracted channel that has fewer states compared to the\noriginal channel, in order to make the analysis tractable. Using a Correlation\nLemma, we then show that an outer-bound on the capacity region of the\ncontracted channel also serves as an outer-bound for the original channel.\nFinally, using a Conditional Entropy Leakage Lemma, we derive our outer-bound\non the capacity region of the contracted channel, and show that it coincides\nwith the achievable region by either treat-interference-as-erasure or\ninterference-decoding at each receiver. We also show that having access to\ndelayed local knowledge of the channel state information, does not enlarge the\ncapacity region.\n'

S'  A drawing of a graph is {\\em pseudolinear} if there is a pseudoline\narrangement such that each pseudoline contains exactly one edge of the drawing.\nThe {\\em pseudolinear crossing number} of a graph $G$ is the minimum number of\npairwise crossings of edges in a pseudolinear drawing of $G$. We establish\nseveral facts on the pseudolinear crossing number, including its computational\ncomplexity and its relationship to the usual crossing number and to the\nrectilinear crossing number. This investigation was motivated by open questions\nand issues raised by Marcus Schaefer in his comprehensive survey of the many\nvariants of the crossing number of a graph.\n'

S'  A class of robust estimators of scatter applied to information-plus-impulsive\nnoise samples is studied, where the sample information matrix is assumed of low\nrank; this generalizes the study of (Couillet et al., 2013b) to spiked random\nmatrix models. It is precisely shown that, as opposed to sample covariance\nmatrices which may have asymptotically unbounded (eigen-)spectrum due to the\nsample impulsiveness, the robust estimator of scatter has bounded spectrum and\nmay contain isolated eigenvalues which we fully characterize. We show that, if\nfound beyond a certain detectability threshold, these eigenvalues allow one to\nperform statistical inference on the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the\ninformation matrix. We use this result to derive new eigenvalue and eigenvector\nestimation procedures, which we apply in practice to the popular array\nprocessing problem of angle of arrival estimation. This gives birth to an\nimproved algorithm based on the MUSIC method, which we refer to as robust\nG-MUSIC.\n'

S"  Combining the modified matrix-vector equation approach with the technique of\nLyapunov majorant function and the Banach fixed point principle, we obtain new\nrigorous perturbation bounds for the LU and QR factorizations with normwise or\ncomponentwise perturbations in the given matrix, where the componentwise\nperturbations have the form of backward error resulting from the standard\nfactorization algorithms. Each of the new rigorous perturbation bounds is a\nrigorous version of the first-order perturbation bound derived by the\nmatrix-vector equation approach in the literature, and we present their\nexplicit expressions. These bounds improve the results given by Chang &\nStehl\\'{e} (2010). Moreover, we derive new sharper first-order perturbation\nbounds including two optimal ones for the LU factorization, and provide the\nexplicit expressions of the optimal first-order perturbation bounds for the LU\nand QR factorizations.\n"

S'  We address the problem of testing whether a dynamic graph is temporally\nconnected, i.e. a temporal path ({\\em journey}) exists between all pairs of\nvertices. We consider a discrete version of the problem, where the topology is\ngiven as an evolving graph $\\G=\\{G_1,G_2,...,G_{k}\\}$ in which only the set of\n(directed) edges varies. Two cases are studied, depending on whether a single\nedge or an unlimited number of edges can be crossed in a same $G_i$ (strict\njourneys {\\it vs} non-strict journeys). For strict journeys, two existing\nalgorithms designed for other problems can be adapted. However, we show that a\ndedicated approach achieves a better time complexity than one of these two\nalgorithms in all cases, and than the other one for those graphs whose density\nis low at any time (though arbitrary over time). The time complexity of our\nalgorithm is $O(k\\mu n)$, where $k=|\\G|$ is the number of time steps and\n$\\mu=max(|E_i|)$ is the maximum {\\em instant} density, to be contrasted with\n$m=|\\cup E_i|$, the {\\em cumulated} density. Indeed, it is not uncommon for a\nmobility scenario to satisfy, for instance, both $\\mu=o(n)$ and\n$m=\\Theta(n^2)$. We characterize the key values of $k, \\mu$ and $m$ for which\nour algorithm should be used. For non-strict journeys, for which no algorithm\nis known, we show that a similar strategy can be used to answer the question,\nstill in $O(k\\mu n)$ time.\n'

The initial guess is obtained by Born approximation based on the\nfact of weak scattering. The reconstruction is then improved each time by an\nincrement on wave number. Finite element method is used for the interior domain\ncontaining inhomogeneity. Nystr\\"om method is used for setting up the boundary\nconditions and jump conditions.

Exploiting a block sparse source model,\nwe use Gaussian mixture density for modeling the distribution of the source.\nThis allows us to formulate an optimal rate allocation problem for the vector\nquantizer. Considering noisy CS quantized measurements, we analyze upper- and\nlower-bounds on reconstruction error performance guarantee of two estimators -\nconvex relaxation based basis pursuit de-noising estimator and an\noracle-assisted least-squares estimator.\n'

S'  We present a fast direct algorithm for computing symmetric factorizations,\ni.e. $A = WW^T$, of symmetric positive-definite hierarchical matrices with\nweak-admissibility conditions. The computational cost for the symmetric\nfactorization scales as $\\mathcal{O}(n \\log^2 n)$ for hierarchically\noff-diagonal low-rank matrices. Once this factorization is obtained, the cost\nfor inversion, application, and determinant computation scales as\n$\\mathcal{O}(n \\log n)$. In particular, this allows for the near optimal\ngeneration of correlated random variates in the case where $A$ is a covariance\nmatrix. This symmetric factorization algorithm depends on two key ingredients.\nFirst, we present a novel symmetric factorization formula for low-rank updates\nto the identity of the form $I+UKU^T$. This factorization can be computed in\n$\\mathcal{O}(n)$ time, if the rank of the perturbation is sufficiently small.\nSecond, combining this formula with a recursive divide-and-conquer strategy,\nnear linear complexity symmetric factorizations for hierarchically structured\nmatrices can be obtained. We present numerical results for matrices relevant to\nproblems in probability \\& statistics (Gaussian processes), interpolation\n(Radial basis functions), and Brownian dynamics calculations in fluid mechanics\n(the Rotne-Prager-Yamakawa tensor).\n'

This decreases both ADC building and\noperational costs. Our design is based on maximal ratio combining (MRC),\nzero-forcing (ZF), and least squares (LS) detection, taking into account the\neffects of the 1-bit ADC on channel estimation. Through numerical results, we\nshow good performance of the system in terms of mutual information and symbol\nerror rate (SER). Furthermore, we provide an analytical approach to calculate\nthe mutual information and SER of the MRC receiver. The analytical approach\nreduces complexity in the sense that a symbol and channel noise vectors Monte\nCarlo simulation is avoided.\n'

S'  The domination game on a graph $G$ (introduced by B. Bre\\v{s}ar, S.\nKlav\\v{z}ar, D.F. Rall \\cite{BKR2010}) consists of two players, Dominator and\nStaller, who take turns choosing a vertex from $G$ such that whenever a vertex\nis chosen by either player, at least one additional vertex is dominated.\nDominator wishes to dominate the graph in as few steps as possible, and Staller\nwishes to delay this process as much as possible. The game domination number\n$\\gamma _{{\\small g}}(G)$ is the number of vertices chosen when Dominator\nstarts the game; when Staller starts, it is denoted by $\\gamma _{{\\small\ng}}^{\\prime }(G).$\n  In this paper, the domination game on line graph $L\\left(\nK_{\\overline{m}}\\right) $ of complete multipartite graph $K_{\\overline{m}}$\n$(\\overline{m}\\equiv (m_{1},...,m_{n})\\in \\mathbb{N} ^{n})$ is considered, the\nexact values for game domination numbers are obtained and optimal strategy for\nboth players is described.

S"  The limiting extremal processes of the branching Brownian motion (BBM), the\ntwo-speed BBM, and the branching random walk are known to be randomly shifted\ndecorated Poisson point processes (SDPPP). In the proofs of those results, the\nLaplace functional of the limiting extremal process is shown to satisfy\n$L[\\theta_y f]=g(y-\\tau_f)$ for any nonzero, nonnegative, compactly supported,\ncontinuous function $f$, where $\\theta_y$ is the shift operator, $\\tau_f$ is a\nreal number that depends on $f$, and $g$ is a real function that is independent\nof $f$. We show that, under some assumptions, this property characterizes the\nstructure of SDPPP. Moreover, when it holds, we show that $g$ has to be a\nconvolution of the Gumbel distribution with some measure.\n  The above property of the Laplace functional is closely related to a\n`freezing phenomenon' that is expected by physicists to occur in a wide class\nof log-correlated fields, and which has played an important role in the\nanalysis of various models. Our results shed light on this intriguing\nphenomenon and provide a natural tool for proving an SDPPP structure in these\nand other models.\n"

S'  The industry is satisfying the increasing demand for wireless bandwidth by\ndensely deploying a large number of access points which are centrally managed,\ne.g. enterprise WiFi networks deployed in university campuses, companies,\nairports etc. This small cell architecture is gaining traction in the cellular\nworld as well, as witnessed by the direction in which 4G+ and 5G\nstandardization is moving. Prior academic work in analyzing such large-scale\nwireless networks either uses oversimplified models for the physical layer, or\nignores other important, real-world aspects of the problem, like MAC layer\nconsiderations, topology characteristics, and protocol overhead. On the other\nhand, the industry is using for deployment purposes on-site surveys and\nsimulation tools which do not scale, cannot efficiently optimize the design of\nsuch a network, and do not explain why one design choice is better than\nanother. In this paper we introduce a simple yet accurate analytical model\nwhich combines the realism and practicality of industrial simulation tools with\nthe ability to scale, analyze the effect of various design parameters, and\noptimize the performance of real- world deployments. The model takes into\naccount all central system parameters, including channelization, power\nallocation, user scheduling, load balancing, MAC, advanced PHY techniques\n(single and multi user MIMO as well as cooperative transmission from multiple\naccess points), topological characteristics and protocol overhead. The accuracy\nof the model is verified via extensive simulations and the model is used to\nstudy a wide range of real world scenarios, providing design guidelines on the\neffect of various design parameters on performance.\n'

S'  The sum-capacity of a three user interference wired network for time-varying\nchannels is considered. Due to the channel variations, it is assumed that the\ntransmitters are only able to track the connectivity between the individual\nnodes, thus only the (alternating) state of the network is known. By\nconsidering a special subset of all possible states, we show that state\nsplitting combined with joint encoding over the alternating states is required\nto achieve the sum-capacity. Regarding upper bounds, we use a genie aided\napproach to show the optimality of this scheme. This highlights that more\ninvolved transmit strategies are required for characterizing the degrees of\nfreedom even if the transmitters have heavily restricted channel state\ninformation.\n'

S'  Learning a distance function or metric on a given data manifold is of great\nimportance in machine learning and pattern recognition. Many of the previous\nworks first embed the manifold to Euclidean space and then learn the distance\nfunction. However, such a scheme might not faithfully preserve the distance\nfunction if the original manifold is not Euclidean. Note that the distance\nfunction on a manifold can always be well-defined. In this paper, we propose to\nlearn the distance function directly on the manifold without embedding. We\nfirst provide a theoretical characterization of the distance function by its\ngradient field. Based on our theoretical analysis, we propose to first learn\nthe gradient field of the distance function and then learn the distance\nfunction itself. Specifically, we set the gradient field of a local distance\nfunction as an initial vector field. Then we transport it to the whole manifold\nvia heat flows on vector fields. Finally, the geodesic distance function can be\nobtained by requiring its gradient field to be close to the normalized vector\nfield. Experimental results on both synthetic and real data demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our proposed algorithm.\n'

S'  Hidden Markov models (HMMs) are widely used statistical models for modeling\nsequential data. The parameter estimation for HMMs from time series data is an\nimportant learning problem. The predominant methods for parameter estimation\nare based on local search heuristics, most notably the expectation-maximization\n(EM) algorithm. These methods are prone to local optima and oftentimes suffer\nfrom high computational and sample complexity. Recent years saw the emergence\nof spectral methods for the parameter estimation of HMMs, based on a method of\nmoments approach. Two spectral learning algorithms as proposed by Hsu, Kakade\nand Zhang 2012 (arXiv:0811.4413) and Anandkumar, Hsu and Kakade 2012\n(arXiv:1203.0683) are assessed in this work. Using experiments with synthetic\ndata, the algorithms are compared with each other. Furthermore, the spectral\nmethods are compared to the Baum-Welch algorithm, a well-established method\napplying the EM algorithm to HMMs. The spectral algorithms are found to have a\nmuch more favorable computational and sample complexity. Even though the\nalgorithms readily handle high dimensional observation spaces, instability\nissues are encountered in this regime. In view of learning from real-world\nexperimental data, the representation of real-valued observations for the use\nin spectral methods is discussed, presenting possible methods to represent data\nfor the use in the learning algorithms.\n'

S'  A graph $G$ is sparse if for every $X\\subseteq V(G)$ with $|X|\\ge 2$, the\nnumber of edges induced by $X$ is at most $2|X|-3$. We prove a characterization\nof graphs that can be decomposed to sparse graphs and forests, which extends\nthe well-known result of Nash-Williams on decomposing graphs into forests. As\nan application, we show that if the fractional arboricity $\\gamma(G)<k+1$, then\n$G$ decomposes into $k$ forests and a subgraph with maximum degree at most\n$(2|V(G)|-5)/3$, which strengthens the Weaker Nine Dragon Tree Conjecture\n\\cite{MORZ12} when $\\gamma(G)$ is close to $k+1$.\n  We also provide partition conditions for a graph with edge-disjoint spanning\nrigid subgraphs and spanning trees. In particular, we prove that every $[3k+l,\nk]$-partition-connected graph with multiplicity at most $k$ contains\nedge-disjoint $k$ spanning rigid subgraphs and $l$ spanning trees. As a\ncorollary, every $(6k+2l, 2k)$-connected graph with multiplicity at most $k$\ncontains edge-disjoint $k$ spanning rigid subgraphs and $l$ spanning trees,\nwhich is a multigraph version of a theorem of Cheriyan, Durand de Gevigney and\nSzigeti \\cite{ChGS14}.\n'

S'  This paper proposes an interference alignment method with distributed and\ndelayed channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT) for a class of\ninterference networks. The core idea of the proposed method is to align\ninterference signals over time at the unintended receivers in a distributed\nmanner. With the proposed method, trade-off regions between the sum of degrees\nof freedom (sum-DoF) and feedback delay of CSI are characterized in both the X\nchannel and three-user interference channel to reveal the impact on on how the\nCSI feedback delay affects the sum-DoF of the interference networks. A major\nimplication of derived results is that distributed and moderately-delayed CSIT\nis useful to obtain strictly better the sum-DoF over the case of no CSI at the\ntransmitter in a certain class of interference networks. For a class of X\nchannels, the results show how to optimally use distributed and\nmoderately-delayed CSIT to yield the same sum-DoF as instantaneous and global\nCSIT. Further, leveraging the proposed transmission method and the known outer\nbound results, the ergodic sum-capacity of the two-user X channel is\ncharacterized within a constant bit.\n'

S'  An oriented graph $G^\\sigma$ is a digraph without loops and multiple arcs,\nwhere $G$ is called the underlying graph of $G^\\sigma$. Let $S(G^\\sigma)$\ndenote the skew-adjacency matrix of $G^\\sigma$. The rank of the skew-adjacency\nmatrix of $G^\\sigma$ is called the {\\it skew-rank} of $G^\\sigma$, denoted by\n$sr(G^\\sigma)$. The skew-adjacency matrix of an oriented graph is skew\nsymmetric and the skew-rank is even. In this paper we consider the skew-rank of\nsimple oriented graphs. Firstly we give some preliminary results about the\nskew-rank. Secondly we characterize the oriented graphs with skew-rank 2 and\ncharacterize the oriented graphs with pendant vertices which attain the\nskew-rank 4. As a consequence, we list the oriented unicyclic graphs, the\noriented bicyclic graphs with pendant vertices which attain the skew-rank 4.\nMoreover, we determine the skew-rank of oriented unicyclic graphs of order $n$\nwith girth $k$ in terms of matching number. We investigate the minimum value of\nthe skew-rank among oriented unicyclic graphs of order $n$ with girth $k$ and\ncharacterize oriented unicyclic graphs attaining the minimum value. In\naddition, we consider oriented unicyclic graphs whose skew-adjacency matrices\nare nonsingular.\n'

From this fact and some basic properties of Hermitian Higgs bundles,\nwe conclude several results. In particular we show that, in analogy to the\nclassical case, there are vanishing theorems for invariant sections of tensor\nproducts of Higgs bundles. Then, we prove that a Higgs bundle admits no nonzero\ninvariant sections if there is a condition of negativity on the greatest\neigenvalue of the Hitchin-Simpson mean curvature. Finally, we prove that the\ninvariant sections of certain tensor products of a weak Hermitian-Yang-Mills\nHiggs bundle are all parallel in the classical sense.\n'

The optimality of VQ\nencoder-decoder pairs is addressed by minimizing the sum of mean-square errors\nbetween the sparse sources and their reconstruction vectors at the fusion\ncenter. We derive a lower-bound on the end-to-end performance of the studied\ndistributed system, and propose a practical encoder-decoder design through an\niterative algorithm.\n'

To establish such formula the main difficulty\nis the exponential integrability of some nonlinear integrals, which is proved\nto be true under some mild conditions on the covariance of $W$. Along the way,\nwe also obtain an upper bound for increments of stochastic processes on\nmultidimensional rectangles by majorizing measures.\n'

S'  We consider the distributed detection of a zero-mean Gaussian signal in an\nanalog wireless sensor network with a fusion center (FC) configured with a\nlarge number of antennas. The transmission gains of the sensor nodes are\noptimized by minimizing the ratio of the log probability of detection (PD) and\nlog probability of false alarm (PFA). We show that the problem is convex with\nrespect to the squared norm of the transmission gains, and that a closed-form\nsolution can be found using the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions. Our results\nindicate that a constant PD can be maintained with decreasing sensor transmit\ngain provided that the number of antennas increases at the same rate. This is\ncontrasted with the case of a single-antenna FC, where PD is monotonically\ndecreasing with transmit gain. On the other hand, we show that when the\ntransmit power is high, the single- and multi-antenna FC both asymptotically\nachieve the same PD upper bound.\n'

S'  Many hard graph problems can be solved efficiently when restricted to graphs\nof bounded treewidth, and more generally to graphs of bounded clique-width. But\nthere is a price to be paid for this generality, exemplified by the four\nproblems MaxCut, Graph Coloring, Hamiltonian Cycle and Edge Dominating Set that\nare all FPT parameterized by treewidth but none of which can be FPT\nparameterized by clique-width unless FPT = W[1], as shown by Fomin et al [7,\n8]. We therefore seek a structural graph parameter that shares some of the\ngenerality of clique-width without paying this price. Based on splits, branch\ndecompositions and the work of Vatshelle [18] on Maximum Matching-width, we\nconsider the graph parameter sm-width which lies between treewidth and\nclique-width. Some graph classes of unbounded treewidth, like\ndistance-hereditary graphs, have bounded sm-width. We show that MaxCut, Graph\nColoring, Hamiltonian Cycle and Edge Dominating Set are all FPT parameterized\nby sm-width.\n'

S'  This paper characterizes the performance of cellular networks employing\nmultiple antenna open-loop spatial multiplexing techniques. We use a stochastic\ngeometric framework to model distance depended inter cell interference. Using\nthis framework, we analyze the coverage and rate using two linear receivers,\nnamely, partial zero-forcing (PZF) and minimum-mean-square-estimation (MMSE)\nreceivers. Analytical expressions are obtained for coverage and rate\ndistribution that are suitable for fast numerical computation.\n  In the case of the PZF receiver, we show that it is not optimal to utilize\nall the receive antenna for canceling interference. With $\\alpha$ as the path\nloss exponent, $N_t$ transmit antenna, $N_r$ receive antenna, we show that it\nis optimal to use $N_t\\left\\lceil\\left(1-\\frac{2}{\\alpha}\\right) \\left(\n\\frac{N_r}{N_t} -\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\right\\rceil$ receive antennas for\ninterference cancellation and the remaining antennas for signal enhancement\n(array gain). For both PZF and MMSE receivers, we observe that increasing the\nnumber of data streams provides an improvement in the mean data rate with\ndiminishing returns. Also transmitting $N_r$ streams is not optimal in terms of\nthe mean sum rate. We observe that increasing the SM rate with a PZF receiver\nalways degrades the cell edge data rate while the performance with MMSE\nreceiver is nearly independent of the SM rate.\n'

In the paper of Buryak and Feigin (arXiv:1206.5640),\nalgebraic geometry is used to prove a generating function identity which\nimplies that $h_{1,1}$ is equidistributed with $a_2$, the largest part of a\npartition that appears at least twice, over the partitions of a given size.

S'  Ramsey theory is the study of conditions under which mathematical objects\nshow order when partitioned. Ramsey theory on the integers concerns itself with\npartitions of $[1,n]$ into $r$ subsets and asks the question whether one (or\nmore) of these $r$ subsets contains a $k$-term member of $\\mathcal{F}$, where\n$[1,n]=\\{1,2,3,\\ldots,n\\}$ and $\\mathcal{F}$ is a certain family of subsets of\n$\\mathbb{Z}^+$. When $\\mathcal{F}$ is fixed to be the set of arithmetic\nprogressions, the corresponding Ramsey-type numbers are called the van der\nWaerden numbers.\n  I started the project choosing $\\mathcal{F}$ to be the set of\nsemi-progressions of scope $m$. A semi-progression of scope $m\\in \\mathbb{Z}^+$\nis a set of integers $\\{x_1,x_2,\\ldots,x_k\\}$ such that for some\n$d\\in\\mathbb{Z}^+$, $x_{i}-x_{i-1}\\in\\{d,2d,\\ldots,md\\}$ for all\n$i\\in\\{2,3,\\ldots,k\\}$. The exact values of Ramsey-type functions corresponding\nto semi-progressions are not known. We use $SP_m(k)$ to denote these numbers as\na Ramsey-type function of $k$ for a fixed scope $m$. During this project, I\nused the probabilistic method to get an exponential lower bound for any fixed\n$m$. The first chapter starts with a brief introduction to Ramsey theory and\nthen explains the problem considered. In the second chapter, I give the results\nobtained on semi-progressions. In the third chapter, I will discuss the lower\nbound obtained on $Q_1(k)$. When $\\mathcal{F}$ is chosen to be\nquasi-progressions of diameter $n$, the corresponding Ramsey-type numbers\nobtained are denoted as $Q_n(k)$. The last chapter gives an exposition of\nadvanced probabilistic techniques, in particular concentration inequalities and\nhow to apply them.\n'

S'  The chromatic symmetric function of a graph is a generalization of the\nchromatic polynomial. The key motivation for studying the structure of a\nchromatic symmetric function is to answer positivity conjectures by Stanley in\n1995 and Gasharov in 1996. As a symmetric function one can write the chromatic\nsymmetric function in the basis of Schur functions. In this paper we address\nthe positivity of the Schur coefficients when the parameter of the Schur\nfunction is a hook shape. Furthermore, when a graph is the incomparability\ngraph of a poset with specific properties we construct a correspondence between\nacyclic orientations of the graph and P-tableaux with a hook shape.\n'

These codes are so-called\n(partial) unit memory ((P)UM) codes, i.e., convolutional codes with memory one.\nFirst, distance measures for convolutional codes in rank metric are shown and\ntwo constructions of (P)UM codes in rank metric based on the generator matrices\nof maximum rank distance codes are presented. Second, an efficient\nerror-erasure decoding algorithm for these codes is presented. Its guaranteed\ndecoding radius is derived and its complexity is bounded. Finally, it is shown\nhow to apply these codes for error correction in random linear and affine\nnetwork coding.\n'

S'  In many modern applications, difficulty in evaluating the posterior density\nmakes taking performing a single MCMC step slow; this difficulty can be caused\nby intractable likelihood functions, but also appears for routine problems with\nlarge data sets. Many researchers have responded by running approximate\nversions of MCMC algorithms. In this note, we develop very general quantitative\nbounds for showing the ergodicity of these approximate samplers. In particular,\nour bounds can be used to perform a bias-variance trade-off argument to give\npractical guidance on the quality of approximation that should be used for a\ngiven total computational budget. We present a few applications of our results\nin recently proposed algorithms, including the "austerity" framework,\nStochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics, exponential random graphs and ABC-MCMC\nalgorithms.\n'

S'  In this paper we discuss global well - posedness and scattering for some\ninitial value problems that are $L^{2}$ supercritical and $\\dot{H}^{1}$\nsubcritical, with radial data. We prove global well - posedness and scattering\nfor radial data in $H^{s}$, $s > s_{c}$, where the problem is $\\dot{H}^{s_{c}}$\n- critical. We make use of the long time Strichartz estimates of \\cite{D2} to\ndo this.\n'
