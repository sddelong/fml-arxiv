To run this script, enter

python Arxiver.py

at the command line.  This will prompt you to set up Arxiver objects
or update those that have already been created.  Each Arxiver object
deals with any number of specified subjects and subcategories within
those subjects. Each Arxiver has a separate algorithm which it
trains indepdentently of other Arxiver objects that may have been created.
