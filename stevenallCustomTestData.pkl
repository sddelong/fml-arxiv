S'  Many computer vision problems (e.g., camera calibration, image alignment,\nstructure from motion) are solved with nonlinear optimization methods. It is\ngenerally accepted that second order descent methods are the most robust, fast,\nand reliable approaches for nonlinear optimization of a general smooth\nfunction. However, in the context of computer vision, second order descent\nmethods have two main drawbacks: (1) the function might not be analytically\ndifferentiable and numerical approximations are impractical, and (2) the\nHessian may be large and not positive definite. To address these issues, this\npaper proposes generic descent maps, which are average "descent directions" and\nrescaling factors learned in a supervised fashion. Using generic descent maps,\nwe derive a practical algorithm - Supervised Descent Method (SDM) - for\nminimizing Nonlinear Least Squares (NLS) problems. During training, SDM learns\na sequence of decent maps that minimize the NLS. In testing, SDM minimizes the\nNLS objective using the learned descent maps without computing the Jacobian or\nthe Hessian. We prove the conditions under which the SDM is guaranteed to\nconverge. We illustrate the effectiveness and accuracy of SDM in three computer\nvision problems: rigid image alignment, non-rigid image alignment, and 3D pose\nestimation. In particular, we show how SDM achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance in the problem of facial feature detection. The code has been made\navailable at www.humansensing.cs.cmu.edu/intraface.\n'

S'  Biological information is not only stored in the digital chemical sequence of\ndouble helical DNA, but is also encoded in the mechanical properties of the DNA\nstrands, which can influence biochemical processes involving its readout. For\nexample, loop formation in the Lac operon can regulate the expression of key\ngenes, and DNA supercoiling is closely correlated to rhythmic circardian gene\nexpression in cyanobacteria. Supercoiling is also important for large scale\norganisation of the genome in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells. DNA can\nrespond to torsional stress by writhing to form looped structures called\nplectonemes, thus transferring energy stored as twist into energy stored in\nbending. Denaturation bubbles can also relax torsional stress, with the\nenthalpic cost of breaking bonds being compensated by their ability to absorb\nundertwist. Here we predict a novel regime where bubbles form at the tips of\nplectonemes, and study its properties using coarse-grained simulations. These\ntip bubbles can occur for both positive and negative supercoiling and greatly\nreduce plectoneme diffusion by a pinning mechanism. They can cause plectonemes\nto preferentially localise to AT rich regions, because bubbles more easily form\nthere. The tip-bubble regime occurs for supercoiling densities and forces that\nare typically encountered for DNA in vivo, and may be exploited for biological\ncontrol of genomic processes.\n'

S"  In this paper we present a theory that predicts the phase noise\ncharacteristics of self-sustained optomechanical oscillators. By treating the\ncavity optomechanical system as a feedback loop consisting of an optical cavity\nand a mechanical resonator, we analytically derive the transfer functions\nrelating the amplitude/phase noise of all the relevant dynamical quantities\nfrom the quantum Langevin equations, and obtain a closed-form expressions for\nthe phase noise spectral densities contributed from thermomechanical noise,\nphoton shot noise, and low-frequency technical laser noise. We numerically\ncalculate the phase noise for various situations and perform a sample\ncalculation for an experimentally demonstrated system. We also show that the\npresented model reduces to the well-known Leeson's phase noise model when the\namplitude noise and the amplitude/phase noise inter-transfers are ignored.\n"

The optical\nabsorption spectra of multilayers black phosphorus are shown to vary\nsensitively with thickness, doping, and light polarization. In conjunction with\nexperimental spectra obtained from infrared absorption spectroscopy, we discuss\nthe role of interband coupling and disorder on the observed anisotropic\nabsorption spectra. Multilayers black phosphorus might offer attractive\nalternatives to narrow gap compound semiconductors for optoelectronics across\nmid- to near-infrared frequencies.\n'

Therein the polynomial order $p$ will be usually greater then two,\ni.e. we will consider higher-order methods. Most of the analysis presented here\nis done in the standard energy norm.\n  Nevertheless, the question arises: Is this the right norm for this kind of\nproblem, especially if characteristic layers occur? We will address this\nquestion by looking into a balanced norm.\n  Finally, a-posteriori error analysis is an important tool to construct\nadapted meshes iteratively by solving discrete problems, estimating the error\nand adjusting the mesh accordingly.

S'  Physical understanding of the links between soil swelling, texture,\nstructure, cracking, and sample size is of great interest for the physical\nunderstanding of many processes in the soil-air-water system and for\napplications in civil, agricultural, and environmental engineering. The\nbackground of this work is an available chain of interconnected physical\nshrinkage curve models for clay, intra-aggregate matrix, aggregated soil\nwithout cracks, and soil with cracks. The objective of the work is to\ngeneralize these models to the case of swelling, and to construct the\nphysical-swelling-model chain with a step-by-step transition from clay to\naggregated soil with cracks. The generalization is based on thorough accounting\nfor the analogies and differences between shrinkage and swelling and the\ncorresponding use, modification, or replacement of the soil shrinkage features.\nTwo specific soil swelling features to be used are: (i) air entrapping in pores\nof the contributing clay; and (ii) aggregate destruction with the formation of\nnew aggregate surfaces. The input for the prediction of the swelling curve of\nan aggregated soil coincides with that of the available model of the shrinkage\ncurve. The analysis of available data on the maximum shrink-swell cycle of two\nsoils with different texture and structure, accounting for sample size is\nconducted as applied to swelling curves and to the residual crack volume and\nmaximum-swelling-volume decrease after the shrink-swell cycle. Results of the\nanalysis show evidence in favor of the swelling model chain.\n'

S'  Nanomagnetic Boolean logic paradigms [1,2],implemented with nanomagnets\nencoding binary bits in their bistable magnetization orientations, have\nattracted immense attention because of their non-volatility and the promise of\nunprecedented energy-efficiency. Unfortunately, the energy-efficiency has\nremained elusive because of the large dissipative losses that take place when\nnanomagnets are switched with a magnetic field [3], or spin-transfer-torque\n[4]. Recently, there have been experimental reports of utilizing the Spin Hall\neffect for switching magnets [5,6],as well as theoretical proposals for\nemploying strain to switch single-domain magnetostrictive nanomagnets [7-13],\nthat might reduce the dissipative losses significantly. However, experimental\nwork in strain-induced switching has been limited to magnets that are\nmulti-domain [14] or magnets where strain moves domain walls [15-17]. Here, we\ndemonstrate, for the first time, strain-induced switching of single-domain\nmagnetostrictive nanomagnets of lateral dimensions ~200 nm fabricated on a\npiezoelectric substrate. We also demonstrate a nanomagnetic Boolean NOT gate\nand unidirectional bit information propagation through a finite chain of\ndipole-coupled nanomagnets by "clocking" them with strain. This portends\nultra-low-energy logic processors and mobile electronics that may be able to\noperate solely by harvesting energy from the environment without ever requiring\na battery.\n'

S'  In this work, we combine a systematic experimental investigation of the\npower- and temperature-dependent evolution of the spatial coherence function,\n$g^{(1)}(r)$, in a one-dimensional exciton-polariton channel with a modern\nmicroscopic numerical theory based on a stochastic master equation approach.\nThe spatial coherence function $g^{(1)}(r)$ is extracted via the high-precision\nMichelson interferometry, which allows us to demonstrate that in the regime of\nnon-resonant excitation, the dependence $g^{(1)}(r)$ reaches a saturation value\nwith a plateau, determined by the intensity of pump and effective temperature\nof the crystal lattice. The theory, which for the first time allows treating\nincoherent excitation in a stochastic frame, matches the experimental data with\nexcellent qualitative and quantitative agreement. This allows us to verify the\nprediction that the decay of off diagonal long range order can be almost fully\nsuppressed in one-dimensional condensate systems.\n'

S'  Spin transfer torque affords magnetic nanodevices the potential to act as\nmemory, computing, and microwave elements operating at ultra-low currents and\nat a low energy cost. Spin transfer torque is not only effective in\nmanipulating well-known magnetic structures, such as domain walls and vortices,\nbut can also nucleate previously unattainable nano-magnetic objects, such as\nmagnetic droplets and skyrmions. While the droplet and the skyrmion are both\nsolitons, the former is inherently dynamic and non-topological, whereas the\nlatter is static but topologically protected. Here we show that it is possible\nto combine these properties into a novel dynamic and topologically protected\nmagnetic soliton, a so-called \\textit{droplet skyrmion}, which adds additional\ndegrees of freedom, and functionality, to both droplet and skyrmion based\napplications. We present the conditions required for the topological\ntransformation of a droplet into a droplet skyrmion and furthermore how field\nand current can be used to reversibly tune the magnetic state between a\ndroplet, a droplet skyrmion, a static skyrmion, and a uniform ferromagnetic\nstate.\n'

S'  Backward error initialization and parasitic mode control are well-suited for\nuse in algorithms that arise from a discrete variational principle on\nphase-space dynamics. Dynamical systems described by degenerate Lagrangians,\nsuch as those occurring in phase-space action principles, lead to variational\nmultistep algorithms for the integration of first-order differential equations.\nAs multistep algorithms, an initialization procedure must be chosen and the\nstability of parasitic modes assessed. The conventional selection of initial\nconditions using accurate one-step methods does not yield the best numerical\nperformance for smoothness and stability. Instead, backward error\ninitialization identifies a set of initial conditions that minimize the\namplitude of undesirable parasitic modes. This issue is especially important in\nthe context of structure-preserving multistep algorithms where numerical\ndamping of the parasitic modes would violate the conservation properties. In\nthe presence of growing parasitic modes, the algorithm may also be periodically\nre-initialized to prevent the undesired mode from reaching large amplitude.\nNumerical examples of variational multistep algorithms are presented in which\nthe backward error initialized trajectories outperform those initialized using\nhighly accurate approximations of the true solution.\n'

The goal is to estimate the mean\n\\vectheta at the optimal minimax rate while communicating as few bits as\npossible. We show that in this simple setting, the communication cost scales\nlinearly in the number of dimensions i.e. one needs to deal with different\ndimensions individually.\n'

S'  Interactions between Fermi liquid quasiparticle and gapless bosons, such as\nphotons or quantum critical fluctuations, are expected to destabilize the Fermi\nliquid and lead to overdamping of the bosonic modes. However, coupling\nelectrons to Nambu-Goldstone bosons (NGBs), typically does not have such a\ndramatic effect. This arises because symmetry usually dictates the existence of\nderivatives in the coupling, which makes them vanish in the limit of small\nenergy-momentum transfer. Here we formulate a general criterion which specifies\nwhen this coupling can be free of derivatives, which makes it similar to the\ncoupling to gauge fields or quantum critical modes. This criterion is satisfied\nby the example of the nematic Fermi fluid that spontaneously breaks rotation\nsymmetry while preserving translations, where non-Fermi liquid physics and\noverdamping of NGBs was discussed by Oganesyan-Kivelson-Fradkin. In addition,\nthe criterion also allows us to identify a new kind of symmetry breaking - of\nmagnetic translations - where non vanishing couplings are expected, which is\nconfirmed by an explicit calculation.\n'

S'  We study the density-density correlation function $G({\\bf r},{\\bf r}\')$ in\nthe interfacial region of a fluid (or Ising-like magnet) with short-ranged\ninteractions using square gradient density functional theory. Adopting a simple\ndouble parabola approximation for the bulk free-energy density, we first show\nthat the parallel Fourier transform $G(z,z\';q)$ and local structure factor\n$S(z;q)$ separate into bulk and excess contributions. We attempt to account for\nboth contributions by deriving an interfacial Hamiltonian, characterised by a\nwavevector dependent surface tension $\\sigma(q)$, and then reconstructing\ndensity correlations from correlations in the interface position. We show that\nthe standard crossing criterion identification of the interface, as a surface\nof fixed density (or magnetization), does not explain the separation of\n$G(z,z\';q)$ and the form of the excess contribution. We propose an alternative\ndefinition of the interface position based on the properties of correlations\nbetween points that "float" with the surface and show that this describes the\nfull $q$ and $z$ dependence of the excess contributions to both $G$ and $S$.\nHowever, neither the "crossing-criterion" nor the new "floating interface"\ndefinition of $\\sigma(q)$ are quantities directly measurable from the total\nstructure factor $S^{tot}(q)$ which contains additional $q$ dependence arising\nfrom the non-local relation between fluctuations in the interfacial position\nand local density. Since it is the total structure factor that is measured\nexperimentally or in simulations, our results have repercussions for earlier\nattempts to extract and interpret $\\sigma(q)$.\n'

S'  Many-body correlations can yield key insights into the nature of interacting\nsystems; however, detecting them is often very challenging in many-particle\nphysics, especially in nanoscale systems. Here, taking a phosphorus donor\nelectron spin in a natural-abundance 29Si nuclear spin bath as our model\nsystem, we discover both theoretically and experimentally that many-body\ncorrelations in nanoscale nuclear spin baths produce identifiable signatures in\nthe decoherence of the central spin under multiple-pulse dynamical decoupling\ncontrol. We find that when the number of decoupling -pulses is odd, central\nspin decoherence is primarily driven by second-order nuclear spin correlations\n(pairwise flip-flop processes). In contrast, when the number of -pulses is\neven, fourth-order nuclear spin correlations (diagonal interaction renormalized\npairwise flip-flop processes) are principally responsible for the central spin\ndecoherence. Many-body correlations of different orders can thus be selectively\ndetected by central spin decoherence under different dynamical decoupling\ncontrols, providing a useful approach to probing many-body processes in\nnanoscale nuclear spin baths.\n'

More specifically, we are using a random forest classifier to classify\npixels into joint-based body part categories, much similar to the famous Kinect\npose estimator [11], [12]. However, we are using pure RGB input, i.e. no depth.\nSince the random forest requires a large number of training examples, we are\nusing computer graphics generated, synthetic training data. In addition, we\nassume that we have access to a large number of real images with bounding box\nlabels, extracted for example by a pedestrian detector or a tracking system. We\npropose a new objective function for random forest training that uses the\nweakly labeled data from the target domain to encourage the learner to select\nfeatures that generalize from the synthetic source domain to the real target\ndomain. We demonstrate on a publicly available dataset [6] that the proposed\nobjective function yields a classifier that significantly outperforms a\nbaseline classifier trained using the standard entropy objective [10].\n'

S'  Quantum field theories (QFTs) are among the deepest descriptions of nature.\nIn this sense, different computing approaches have been developed, as Feynman\ndiagrams or lattice gauge theories. In general, the numerical simulations of\nQFTs are computationally hard, with the processing time growing exponentially\nwith the system size. Nevertheless, a quantum simulator could provide an\nefficient way to emulate these theories in polynomial time. Here, we propose\nthe quantum simulation of fermionic field modes interacting via a continuum of\nbosonic modes with superconducting circuits, which are among the most advanced\nquantum technologies in terms of quantum control and scalability. An important\nfeature of superconducting devices is that, unlike other quantum platforms,\nthey offer naturally a strong coupling of qubits to a continuum of bosonic\nmodes. Therefore, this system is a specially suited platform to realize quantum\nsimulations of scattering processes involving interacting fermionic and bosonic\nquantum field theories, where access to the continuum of modes is required.\n'

S'  Using first-principles calculations, we investigated the impact of chromium\n(Cr) and vanadium (V) impurities on the magnetic anisotropy and spin\npolarization in Fe/MgO magnetic tunnel junctions. It is demonstrated using\nlayer resolved anisotropy calculation technique, that while the impurity near\nthe interface has a drastic effect in decreasing the perpendicular magnetic\nanisotropy (PMA), its position within the bulk allows maintaining high surface\nPMA. Moreover, the effective magnetic anisotropy has a strong tendency to go\nfrom in-plane to out-of-plane character as a function of Cr and V concentration\nfavoring out-of-plane magnetization direction for ~1.5 nm thick Fe layers at\nimpurity concentrations above 20 %. At the same time, spin polarization is not\naffected and even enhanced in most situations favoring an increase of tunnel\nmagnetoresistance (TMR) values.\n'

S"  A robust worldwide air-transportation network (WAN) is one that minimizes the\nnumber of stranded passengers under a sequence of airport closures. Here we\naddress how WAN's robustness can profit from local cooperation between\nairports. For this, we reroute a series of flights among airports within a\ncertain distance, a cooperation range, and describe the improvement of WAN's\nrobustness with distance as a continuum transition. We calculate the critical\nexponents and identify a critical cooperation range below which improvement is\nnegligible. We propose a network model that falls into the same universality\nclass in which the probability to connect two nodes decays algebraically with\ntheir distance. Practical implications of this result are also discussed.\n"

It is defined by a complexification of two canonical\ncomplex signals, which can be considered as an inverse operation of the\nCayley-Dickson form of the quaternion. Inspired by the polar form of an\nanalytic signal where the real instantaneous envelope and phase can be\ndetermined, this paper presents a novel method to generate a polar\nrepresentation of the hyperanalytic signal, in which the continuously complex\nenvelope and phase can be uniquely defined. Comparing to other existing\nmethods, the proposed polar representation does not have sign ambiguity between\nthe envelope and the phase, which makes the definition of the instantaneous\ncomplex frequency possible.\n'

S'  A traditional and intuitively appealing Multi-Task Multiple Kernel Learning\n(MT-MKL) method is to optimize the sum (thus, the average) of objective\nfunctions with (partially) shared kernel function, which allows information\nsharing amongst tasks. We point out that the obtained solution corresponds to a\nsingle point on the Pareto Front (PF) of a Multi-Objective Optimization (MOO)\nproblem, which considers the concurrent optimization of all task objectives\ninvolved in the Multi-Task Learning (MTL) problem. Motivated by this last\nobservation and arguing that the former approach is heuristic, we propose a\nnovel Support Vector Machine (SVM) MT-MKL framework, that considers an\nimplicitly-defined set of conic combinations of task objectives. We show that\nsolving our framework produces solutions along a path on the aforementioned PF\nand that it subsumes the optimization of the average of objective functions as\na special case. Using algorithms we derived, we demonstrate through a series of\nexperimental results that the framework is capable of achieving better\nclassification performance, when compared to other similar MTL approaches.\n'

The quantum\ndot is formed by an interface or thickness fluctuation of a GaAs QW embedded in\na AlGaAs shell of a GaAs-AlGaAs core-shell nanowire. As we tune the time at\nwhich carriers are photogenerated during the acoustic cycle, we find pronounced\nintensity oscillations of neutral and negatively charged excitons. At high\nacoustic power levels these oscillations become anticorrelated which enables\ndirect acoustic programming of the dot's charge configuration, emission\nintensity and emission wavelength. Numerical simulations confirm that the\nobserved modulations arise from acoustically controlled modulations of the\nelectron and electron-hole-pair concentrations at the position of the quantum\ndot.\n"

S"  We present a study of the correlated transport regimes of a double quantum\nimpurity system with mutual capacitive interactions. Such system can be\nimplemented by a double quantum dot arrangement or by a quantum dot and nearby\nquantum point contact, with independently connected sets of metallic terminals.\nMany--body spin correlations arising within each dot--lead subsystem give rise\nto the Kondo effect under appropriate conditions. The otherwise independent\nKondo ground states may be modified by the capacitive coupling, decisively\nmodifying the ground state of the double quantum impurity system. We analyze\nthis coupled system through variational methods and the numerical\nrenormalization group technique. Our results reveal a strong dependence of the\ncoupled system ground state on the electron--hole asymmetries of the individual\nsubsystems, as well as on their hybridization strengths to the respective\nreservoirs. The electrostatic repulsion produced by the capacitive coupling\nproduces an effective shift of the individual energy levels toward higher\nenergies, with a stronger effect on the `shallower' subsystem (that closer to\nresonance with the Fermi level), potentially pushing it out of the Kondo regime\nand dramatically changing the transport properties of the system. The effective\nremote gating that this entails is found to depend nonlinearly on the\ncapacitive coupling strength, as well as on the independent subsystem levels.\nThe analysis we present here of this mutual interaction should be important to\nfully characterize transport through such coupled systems.\n"

Since structural inversion asymmetry (SIA) is required\nfor their stability, the observation of chiral domain walls in highly symmetric\nPt/Co/Pt is intriguing. Here, we tune the layer asymmetry in this system and\nobserve, by current-assisted DW depinning experiments, a small chiral field\nwhich sensitively changes. Moreover, we convincingly link the observed\nefficiency of DW motion to the DW texture, using DW resistance as a direct\nprobe for the internal orientation of the DW under the influence of in-plane\nfields. The very delicate effect of capping layer thickness on the chiral field\nallows for its accurate control, which is important in designing novel\nmaterials for optimal spin-orbit-torque-driven DW motion.\n'

S'  While the water molecule is simple, its condensed phase liquid behavior is so\ncomplex that no consensus description has emerged despite three centuries of\neffort. Here we identify features of its behavior that are the most peculiar,\nhence suggest ways forward. We examine the properties of water at the\nboundaries of common experience, including stable states at high pressure, the\nsupercooled state at normal and elevated pressure, and the stretched ("negative\npressure") state, out to the limits of mechanical stability. The familiar\nanomalies at moderate pressures (viscosity and density (TMD) behavior, etc.),\nare not explained by H-bond breaking, according to common bond-breaking\ncriteria. A comparison of data on the TMD, at both positive and negative\npressures, with the predictions of popular pair potential models, shows\ndramatic discrepancies appearing in the stretched liquid domain. This prompts\nquestions on the second critical point (TC2) hypothesis that has been guiding\nmuch current thinking. We turn to related systems for guidance, reviewing a\nhierarchy of water-like anomalies. We conclude that water models are far from\ncomplete and that proper understanding of water will depend on success in\nmastering the measurement of liquid behavior in the negative pressure domain -\nwhich we discuss.\n'

S'  In this work we study the transport properties of non-interacting overdamped\nparticles, moving on tilted disordered potentials, subjected to Gaussian white\nnoise. We give exact formulas for the drift and diffusion coefficients for the\ncase of random potentials resulting from the interaction of a particle with a\n"random polymer". In our model the "random polymer" is made up, by means of\nsome stochastic process, of monomers that can be taken from a finite or\ncountable infinite set of possible monomer types. For the case of uncorrelated\nrandom polymers we found that the diffusion coefficient exhibits a\nnon-monotonous behavior as a function of the noise intensity. Particularly\ninteresting is the fact that the relative diffusivity becomes optimal at a\nfinite temperature, a behavior which is reminiscent to that of stochastic\nresonance. We explain this effect as an interplay between the deterministic and\nnoisy dynamics of the system. We also show that this behavior of the diffusion\ncoefficient at a finite temperature is more pronounced for the case of weakly\ndisordered potentials. We test our findings by means of numerical simulations\nof the corresponding Langevin dynamics of an ensemble of noninteracting\noverdamped particles diffusing on uncorrelated random potentials.\n'

S'  Maximization of the path information entropy is a clear prescription for\nperforming time-dependent plausible inference. Here it is shown that, following\nthis prescription under the assumption of arbitrary instantaneous constraints\non position and velocity, a Lagrangian emerges which determines the most\nprobable trajectory. Deviations from the probability maximum can be\nconsistently described as slices in time by a Hamiltonian, according to a\nnonlinear Langevin equation and its associated Fokker-Planck equation. The\nconnections unveiled between the maximization of path entropy and the\nLangevin/Fokker-Planck equations imply that missing information about the phase\nspace coordinate never decreases in time, a purely information-theoretical\nversion of the Second Law of Thermodynamics. All of these results are\nindependent of any physical assumptions, and thus valid for any generalized\ncoordinate as a function of time, or any other parameter. This reinforces the\nview that the Second Law is a fundamental property of plausible inference.\n'

S'  We present a novel simulation technique derived from Brownian cluster\ndynamics used so far to study the isotropic colloidal aggregation. It now\nimplements the classical Kern-Frenkel potential to describe patchy interactions\nbetween particles. This technique gives access to static properties, dynamics\nand kinetics of the system, even far from the equilibrium. Particle thermal\nmotions are modeled using billions of independent small random translations and\nrotations, constrained by the excluded volume and the connectivity. This\nalgorithm, applied to a single polymer chain leads to correct static and\ndynamic properties, in the framework where hydrodynamic interactions are\nignored. By varying patch angles, various chain flexibilities can be obtained.\nWe have used this new algorithm to model step-growth polymerization under\nvarious solvent qualities. The polymerization reaction is modeled by an\nirreversible aggregation between patches while an isotropic finite square-well\npotential is superimposed to mimic the solvent quality. In bad solvent\nconditions, a competition between a phase separation (due to the isotropic\ninteraction) and polymerization (due to patches) occurs. Surprisingly, an\narrested network with a very peculiar structure appears. It is made of strands\nand nodes. Strands gather few stretched chains that dip into entangled globular\nnodes. These nodes act as reticulation points between the strands. The system\nis kinetically driven and we observe a trapped arrested structure. That\ndemonstrates one of the strengths of this new simulation technique. It can give\nvaluable insights about mechanisms that could be involved in the formation of\nstranded gels.\n'

S'  We revisit the classic thermodynamic problem of maximum work extraction from\ntwo arbitrary sized hot and cold reservoirs, modelled as perfect gases.\nAssuming ignorance about the extent to which the process has advanced, which\nimplies an ignorance about the final temperatures, we quantify the prior\ninformation about the process and assign a prior distribution to the unknown\ntemperature(s). This requires that we also take into account the temperature\nvalues which are regarded to be unphysical in the standard theory, as they lead\nto a contradiction with the physical laws. Instead in our formulation, such\nvalues appear to be consistent with the given prior information and hence are\nincluded in the inference. We derive estimates of the efficiency at optimal\nwork from the expected values of the final temperatures, and show that these\nvalues match with the exact expressions in the limit when any one of the\nreservoirs is very large compared to the other. For other relative sizes of the\nreservoirs, we suggest a weighting procedure over the estimates from two valid\ninference procedures, that generalizes the procedure suggested earlier in [J.\nPhys. A: Math. Theor. {\\bf 46}, 365002 (2013)]. Thus a mean estimate for\nefficiency is obtained which agrees with the optimal performance to a high\naccuracy.\n'

S'  We have investigated the relationship between the morphology of helical\nparticles and the features of the cholesteric (N$^\\ast $) phase that they form.\nUsing an Onsager-like theory, applied to systems of hard helices, we show that\nthe cholesteric handedness and pitch depend on both the pitch and the curliness\nof the particles. The theory leads to the definition of pseudoscalars that\ncorrelate the helical features of the phase to the chirality of the excluded\nvolume of the constituent particles.\n'

S"  We consider the complexity of equivalence and learning for multiplicity tree\nautomata, i.e., weighted tree automata with weights in a field. We first\ncharacterise the complexity of equivalence testing as being logspace equivalent\nto polynomial identity testing. Secondly, we consider the problem of learning\nmultiplicity tree automata in Angluin's exact learning model. Here we give\nlower bounds on the number of queries, both for the case of an arbitrary and a\nfixed underlying field. We also present a learning algorithm in which\ncounterexamples use succinct representations of trees as DAGs. Assuming a\nTeacher that represents counterexamples as succinctly as possible, our\nalgorithm uses exponentially fewer queries than the best previously known\nprocedure, leaving only a polynomial gap with the above-mentioned lower bound.\n"

S'  The moving neutral system of two Coulomb charges on a plane subject to a\nconstant magnetic field $B$ perpendicular to the plane is considered. It is\nshown that the composite system of finite total mass is bound for any\ncenter-of-mass momentum $P$ and magnetic field strength; the energy of the\nground state is calculated accurately using a variational approach. Their\naccuracy is cross-checked in Lagrange-mesh method for $B=1$\\,a.u. and in a\nperturbation theory at small $B$ and $P$. The constructed trial function has a\nproperty to be a uniform approximation of the exact eigenfunction. For Hydrogen\natom and Positronium a double perturbation theory in $B$ and $P$ is developed\nand the first corrections are found algebraically. A phenomenon of a sharp\nchange of energy behavior for a certain center-of-mass momentum but a fixed\nmagnetic field is indicated.\n'

S'  Key frame extraction algorithms consider the problem of selecting a subset of\nthe most informative frames from a video to summarize its content. Several\napplications such as video summarization, search, indexing and prints from\nvideo can benefit from extracted key frames of the video under consideration.\nMost approaches in this class of algorithms work directly with the input video\ndataset, without considering the underlying low rank structure of the dataset.\nOther algorithms exploit the low rank component only; ignoring the other key\ninformation in the video. In this paper, a novel key frame extraction framework\nbased on Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA) is proposed. Furthermore,\nwe target the challenging application of extracting key frames from\nunstructured consumer videos. The proposed framework is motivated by the\nobservation that RPCA decomposes an input data into (a) a low rank component\nthat reveals the systematic information across the elements of the dataset and\n(b) a set of sparse components each of which containing distinct information\nabout each element in the same dataset. The two information types are combined\ninto a single l1-norm based non-convex optimization problem to extract the\ndesired number of key frames. Moreover, we develop a novel iterative algorithm\nto solve this optimization problem. The proposed RPCA-based framework does not\nrequire shot(s) detection, segmentation, or semantic understanding of the\nunderlying video. Finally, experiments are performed on a variety of consumer\nvideos. A comparison of the results obtained by our method with the ground\ntruth and related state-of-the-art algorithms clearly indicates the viability\nof the proposed RPCA-based framework.\n'

S'  Performance accuracy of the Euclidean Distance Discriminant rule (EDDR) is\nstudied in the high-dimensional asymptotic framework which allows the\ndimensionality to exceed sample size. Under mild assumptions on the traces of\nthe covariance matrix, our new results provide the asymptotic distribution of\nthe conditional misclassification error and the explicit expression for the\nconsistent and asymptotically unbiased estimator of the expected\nmisclassification error. To get these properties, new results on the asymptotic\nnormality of the quadratic forms and traces of the higher power of Wishart\nmatrix, are established. Using our asymptotic results, we further develop two\ngeneric methods of determining a cut-off point for EDDR to adjust the\nmisclassification errors. Finally, we numerically justify the high accuracy of\nour asymptotic findings along with the cut-off determination methods in finite\nsample applications, inclusive of the large sample and high-dimensional\nscenarios.\n'

S"  We consider interacting population systems of predator-prey type, presenting\nfour models of control strategies for epidemics among the prey. In particular\nto contain the transmissible disease, safety niches are considered, assuming\nthey lessen the disease spread, but do not protect prey from predators. This\nrepresents a novelty with respect to standard ecosystems where the refuge\nprevents predators' attacks. The niche is assumed either to protect the healthy\nindividuals, or to hinder the infected ones to get in contact with the\nsusceptibles, or finally to reduce altogether contacts that might lead to new\ncases of the infection. In addition a standard culling procedure is also\nanalysed. The effectiveness of the different strategies are compared. Probably\nthe environments providing a place where disease carriers cannot come in\ncontact with the healthy individuals, or where their contact rates are lowered,\nseem to preferable for disease containment.\n"

S'  Injection, transmission, and detection of spins in a conducting channel are\nthe basic ingredients of spintronic devices. Long spin lifetimes during transit\nare an important ingredient in realizing this technology. An attractive\nplatform for this purpose is graphene, which has high mobilities and low\nspin-orbit coupling. Unfortunately, measured spin lifetimes are orders of\nmagnitude smaller than theoretically expected. A source of spin loss is the\nresistance mismatch between the ferromagnetic electrodes and graphene. While\nthis has been studied numerically, here we provide a closed form expression for\nHanle spin precession which is the standard method of measuring spin lifetimes.\nThis allows for a detailed characterization of the nonlocal spin valve device.\n'

In this paper,\nwe showed, unlike the periodic boundary case, both of Neveu-Schwarz (NS) and\nRamond (R) sectors of a superconformal field theory were obtained. Using a\nmethod of nonlinear integral equations for auxiliary functions defined by\neigenvalues of transfer matrices, we found that an excitation state with an odd\nnumber of particles is allowed for a certain value of a boundary parameter even\non a system consisting of an even number of sites. In a small-volume limit\nwhere conformal invariance shows up in the theory, we derived conformal\ndimensions of states constructed through the lattice-regularized theory. The\nresult shows existence of the R sector, which cannot be obtained from the\nperiodic system, while a winding number is restricted to an integer or a\nhalf-integer depending on boundary parameters.\n'

S"  Rare data in a large-scale database are called outliers that reveal\nsignificant information in the real world. The subspace-based outlier detection\nis regarded as a feasible approach in very high dimensional space. However, the\noutliers found in subspaces are only part of the true outliers in high\ndimensional space, indeed. The outliers hidden in normal-clustered points are\nsometimes neglected in the projected dimensional subspace. In this paper, we\npropose a robust subspace method for detecting such inner outliers in a given\ndataset, which uses two dimensional-projections: detecting outliers in\nsubspaces with local density ratio in the first projected dimensions; finding\noutliers by comparing neighbor's positions in the second projected dimensions.\nEach point's weight is calculated by summing up all related values got in the\ntwo steps projected dimensions, and then the points scoring the largest weight\nvalues are taken as outliers. By taking a series of experiments with the number\nof dimensions from 10 to 10000, the results show that our proposed method\nachieves high precision in the case of extremely high dimensional space, and\nworks well in low dimensional space.\n"

To deepen the physical insight of our approach we\ndiscuss various self-consistent expressions for the response function, and\nderive the correlation time in closed form.

S'  We present a content-based retrieval method for long surveillance videos both\nfor wide-area (Airborne) as well as near-field imagery (CCTV). Our goal is to\nretrieve video segments, with a focus on detecting objects moving on routes,\nthat match user-defined events of interest. The sheer size and remote locations\nwhere surveillance videos are acquired, necessitates highly compressed\nrepresentations that are also meaningful for supporting user-defined queries.\nTo address these challenges we archive long-surveillance video through\nlightweight processing based on low-level local spatio-temporal extraction of\nmotion and object features. These are then hashed into an inverted index using\nlocality-sensitive hashing (LSH). This local approach allows for query\nflexibility as well as leads to significant gains in compression. Our second\ntask is to extract partial matches to the user-created query and assembles them\ninto full matches using Dynamic Programming (DP). DP exploits causality to\nassemble the indexed low level features into a video segment which matches the\nquery route. We examine CCTV and Airborne footage, whose low contrast makes\nmotion extraction more difficult. We generate robust motion estimates for\nAirborne data using a tracklets generation algorithm while we use Horn and\nSchunck approach to generate motion estimates for CCTV. Our approach handles\nlong routes, low contrasts and occlusion. We derive bounds on the rate of false\npositives and demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach for counting,\nmotion pattern recognition and abandoned object applications.\n'

S'  Recently regression analysis becomes a popular tool for face recognition. The\nexisting regression methods all use the one-dimensional pixel-based error\nmodel, which characterizes the representation error pixel by pixel individually\nand thus neglects the whole structure of the error image. We observe that\nocclusion and illumination changes generally lead to a low-rank error image. To\nmake use of this low-rank structural information, this paper presents a\ntwo-dimensional image matrix based error model, i.e. matrix regression, for\nface representation and classification. Our model uses the minimal nuclear norm\nof representation error image as a criterion, and the alternating direction\nmethod of multipliers method to calculate the regression coefficients. Compared\nwith the current regression methods, the proposed Nuclear Norm based Matrix\nRegression (NMR) model is more robust for alleviating the effect of\nillumination, and more intuitive and powerful for removing the structural noise\ncaused by occlusion. We experiment using four popular face image databases, the\nExtended Yale B database, the AR database, the Multi-PIE and the FRGC database.\nExperimental results demonstrate the performance advantage of NMR over the\nstate-of-the-art regression based face recognition methods.\n'

S'  We study the performance of a quantum Otto cycle driven by trapping\npotentials of the form $V_t(x) \\sim x^{2q}$. This family of potentials\npossesses a simple scaling property which allows for analytical insights into\nthe efficiency and work output of the cycle. We show that, while both the mean\nwork output and the efficiency of two Otto cycles in different trapping\npotentials can be made equal, the work probability distribution will still be\nstrongly affected by the difference in structure of the energy levels. Lastly,\nwe perform a comparison of quantum Otto cycles in various physically relevant\nscenarios and find that in certain instances, the efficiency of the cycle is\ngreater when using potentials with larger values of $q$, while, in other cases,\nwith harmonic traps.\n'

S'  MOOCs have the potential to revolutionize higher education with their wide\noutreach and accessibility, but they require instructors to come up with\nscalable alternates to traditional student evaluation. Peer grading -- having\nstudents assess each other -- is a promising approach to tackling the problem\nof evaluation at scale, since the number of "graders" naturally scales with the\nnumber of students. However, students are not trained in grading, which means\nthat one cannot expect the same level of grading skills as in traditional\nsettings. Drawing on broad evidence that ordinal feedback is easier to provide\nand more reliable than cardinal feedback, it is therefore desirable to allow\npeer graders to make ordinal statements (e.g. "project X is better than project\nY") and not require them to make cardinal statements (e.g. "project X is a\nB-"). Thus, in this paper we study the problem of automatically inferring\nstudent grades from ordinal peer feedback, as opposed to existing methods that\nrequire cardinal peer feedback. We formulate the ordinal peer grading problem\nas a type of rank aggregation problem, and explore several probabilistic models\nunder which to estimate student grades and grader reliability. We study the\napplicability of these methods using peer grading data collected from a real\nclass -- with instructor and TA grades as a baseline -- and demonstrate the\nefficacy of ordinal feedback techniques in comparison to existing cardinal peer\ngrading methods. Finally, we compare these peer-grading techniques to\ntraditional evaluation techniques.\n'

S'  A quantum spin Hall insulator is a two-dimensional state of matter consisting\nof an insulating bulk and one-dimensional helical edge states. While these edge\nstates are topologically protected against elastic backscattering in the\npresence of disorder, interaction-induced inelastic terms may yield a finite\nconductivity. By using a kinetic equation approach, we find the backscattering\nrate $\\tau^{-1}$ and the semiclassical conductivity in the regimes of high\n($\\omega \\gg \\tau^{-1}$) and low ($\\omega \\ll \\tau^{-1}$) frequency. By\ncomparing the two limits, we find that the parametric dependence of\nconductivity is described by the Drude formula for the case of a disordered\nedge. On the other hand, in the clean case where the resistance originates from\numklapp interactions, the conductivity takes a non-Drude form with a parametric\nsuppression of scattering in the dc limit as compared to the ac case. This\nbehavior is due to the peculiarity of umklapp scattering processes involving\nnecessarily the state at the "Dirac point". In order to take into account\nLuttinger liquid effects, we complement the kinetic equation analysis by\ntreating interactions exactly in bosonization and calculating conductivity\nusing the Kubo formula. In this way, we obtain the frequency and temperature\ndependence of conductivity over a wide range of parameters. We find the\ntemperature and frequency dependence of the transport scattering time in a\ndisordered system as $\\tau \\sim [\\max{(\\omega,T)}]^{-2K-2}$, for $K>2/3$ and\n$\\tau \\sim [\\max{(\\omega,T)}]^{-8K+2}$ for $K <2/3$.\n'

S'  We study the effects of extended and localized potentials and a magnetic\nfield on the Dirac electrons residing at the surface of a three-dimensional\ntopological insulator. We use a lattice model to numerically study the various\nstates; we show how the potentials can be chosen in a way which effectively\navoids the problem of fermion doubling on a lattice. We show that extended\npotentials of different shapes can give rise to states which propagate freely\nalong the potential but decay exponentially away from it. For an infinitely\nlong potential barrier, the dispersion and spin structure of these states are\nunusual and these can be varied continuously by changing the barrier strength.\nIn the presence of a magnetic field applied perpendicular to the surface, these\nstates become separated from the gapless surface states by a gap, thereby\ngiving rise to a quasi-one-dimensional system. Similarly, a magnetic field\nalong with a localized potential can give rise to exponentially localized\nstates which are separated from the surface states by a gap and thereby form a\nzero-dimensional system. Finally, we show that a long barrier and an impurity\npotential can produce bound states which are localized at the impurity, and an\n"L"-shaped potential can have both bound states at the corner of the "L" and\nextended states which travel along the arms of the potential.\n'

S'  We show by means of molecular dynamics simulations that graphene is an\nexcellent coating for diamond. The transformation of diamond to amorphous\ncarbon while sliding under pressure can be prevented by having at least two\ngraphene layers between the diamond slabs, making this combination of materials\nsuitable for new coatings and micro- and nanoelectromechanical devices. Grain\nboundaries, vacancies and adatoms on the diamond surface do not change this\npicture whereas reactive adsorbates between the graphene layers may have\ndetrimental effects. Our findings can be explained by the properties of layered\nmaterials where the weak interlayer bonding evolves to a strong interlayer\nrepulsion under pressure.\n'

S'  When a micron-sized magnetizable particle is introduced into a suspension of\nnanosized magnetic particles, the nanoparticles accumulate around the\nmicroparticle and form thick anisotropic clouds extended in the direction of\nthe applied magnetic field. This phenomenon promotes colloidal stabilization of\nbimodal magnetic suspensions and allows efficient magnetic separation of\nnanoparticles used in bioanalysis and water purification. In the present work,\nsize and shape of nanoparticle clouds under the simultaneous action of an\nexternal uniform magnetic field and the flow have been studied in details. In\nexperiments, dilute suspension of iron oxide nanoclusters (of a mean diameter\nof 60 nm) was pushed through a thin slit channel with the nickel microspheres\n(of a mean diameter of 50$\\mu$m) attached to the channel wall. The behavior of\nnanocluster clouds was observed in the steady state using an optical\nmicroscope. In the presence of strong enough flow, the size of the clouds\nmonotonically decreases with increasing flow speed in both longitudinal and\ntransverse magnetic fields. This is qualitatively explained by enhancement of\nhydrodynamic forces washing the nanoclusters away from the clouds. In the\nlongitudinal field, the flow induces asymmetry of the front and the back\nclouds. To explain the flow and the field effects on the clouds, we have\ndeveloped a simple model based on the balance of the stresses and particle\nfluxes on the cloud surface. This model, applied to the case of the magnetic\nfield parallel to the flow, captures reasonably well the flow effect on the\nsize and shape of the cloud and reveals that the only dimensionless parameter\ngoverning the cloud size is the ratio of hydrodynamic-to-magnetic forces - the\nMason number. At strong magnetic interactions considered in the present work\n(dipolar coupling parameter $\\alpha \\geq 2$), the Brownian motion seems not to\naffect the cloud behavior.\n'

S'  We describe a generic theoretical framework, denoted as the\nBoltzmann-Ginzburg-Landau approach, to derive continuous equations for the\npolar and/or nematic order parameters describing the large scale behavior of\nassemblies of point-like active particles interacting through polar or nematic\nalignment rules. Our study encompasses three main classes of dry active\nsystems, namely polar particles with \'ferromagnetic\' alignment (like the\noriginal Vicsek model), nematic particles with nematic alignment ("active\nnematics"), and polar particles with nematic alignment ("self-propelled rods").\nThe Boltzmann-Ginzburg-Landau approach combines a low-density description in\nthe form of a Boltzmann equation, with a Ginzburg-Landau-type expansion close\nto the instability threshold of the disordered state. We provide the generic\nform of the continuous equations obtained for each class, and comment on the\nrelationships and differences with other approaches.\n'

S'  We study the stochastic behavior of heterogeneous diffusion processes with\nthe power-law dependence $D(x)\\sim|x|^{\\alpha}$ of the generalized diffusion\ncoefficient encompassing sub- and superdiffusive anomalous diffusion. Based on\nstatistical measures such as the amplitude scatter of the time averaged mean\nsquared displacement of individual realizations, the ergodicity breaking and\nnon-Gaussianity parameters, as well as the probability density function\n$P(x,t)$ we analyze the weakly non-ergodic character of the heterogeneous\ndiffusion process and, particularly, the degree of irreproducibility of\nindividual realization. As we show, the fluctuations between individual\nrealizations increase with growing modulus $|\\alpha|$ of the scaling exponent.\nThe fluctuations appear to diverge when the critical value $\\alpha=2$ is\napproached, while for even larger $\\alpha$ the fluctuations decrease, again. At\ncriticality, the power-law behavior of the mean squared displacement changes to\nan exponentially fast growth, and the fluctuations of the time averaged mean\nsquared displacement do not seem to converge for increasing number of\nrealizations. From a systematic comparison we observe some striking\nsimilarities of the heterogeneous diffusion process with the familiar\nsubdiffusive continuous time random walk process with power-law waiting time\ndistribution and diverging characteristic waiting time.\n'

S'  Wang et al. [PNAS 106 (2009) 15160] have found that in several systems the\nlinear time dependence of the mean-square displacement (MSD) of diffusing\ncolloidal particles, typical of normal diffusion, is accompanied by a\nnon-Gaussian displacement distribution (DisD), with roughly exponential tails\nat short times, a situation they termed "anomalous yet Brownian" diffusion. The\ndiversity of systems in which this is observed calls for a generic model. We\npresent such a model where there is "diffusivity memory" but no "direction\nmemory" in the particle trajectory, and we show that it leads to both a linear\nMSD and a non-Gaussian DisD at short times. In our model, the diffusivity is\nundergoing a (perhaps biased) random walk, hence the expression "diffusing\ndiffusivity". The DisD is predicted to be exactly exponential at short times if\nthe distribution of diffusivities is itself exponential, but an exponential\nremains a good fit to the DisD for a variety of diffusivity distributions.\nMoreover, our generic model can be modified to produce subdiffusion.\n'

Upon applying a transverse magnetic\nfield to the single-ion magnet, we observe oscillations of the Kondo effect due\nto the presence of diabolical (degeneracy) points of the energy spectrum of the\nmolecule caused by a geometrical phase interference effects similar to those\nobserved in the quantum tunneling of multi-ion molecular nanomagnets. The\nfield-induced lifting of the ground state degeneracy competes with the\ninterference modulation, resulting in some cases in a suppression of the Kondo\npeak.\n'

S'  Accurate distance measurement in 3D confocal microscopy is important for\nquantitative analysis, volume visualization and image restoration. However,\naxial distances can be distorted by both the point spread function and by a\nrefractive-index mismatch between the sample and immersion liquid, which are\ndifficult to separate. Additionally, accurate calibration of the axial\ndistances in confocal microscopy remains cumbersome, although several high-end\nmethods exist. In this paper we present two methods to calibrate axial\ndistances in 3D confocal microscopy that are both accurate and easily\nimplemented. With these methods, we measured axial scaling factors as a\nfunction of refractive-index mismatch for high-aperture confocal microscopy\nimaging. We found that our scaling factors are almost completely linearly\ndependent on refractive index and that they were in good agreement with\ntheoretical predictions that take the full vectorial properties of light into\naccount. There was however a strong deviation with the theoretical predictions\nusing (high-angle) geometrical optics, which predict much lower scaling\nfactors. As an illustration, we measured the point-spread-function of a\npoint-scanning confocal microscope and showed that an index-matched,\nmicron-sized spherical object is still significantly elongated due to this PSF,\nwhich confirms that single micron-sized spheres are not well suited to\ndetermine accurate axial calibration nor axial scaling.\n'

We show that, for the sudden\nquench, it is in general possible to retrieve the whole non-equilibrium\nthermodynamics via single projective measurements of observables. We highlight\nin a physically clear way the qualitative implications for the statistics of\nwork coming from considering processes described by operators that either\ncommute or do not commute with the unperturbed Hamiltonian of a given system.\nWe consider a quantum many-body system and derive an expression that allows us\nto give a physical interpretation to all of the cumulants of the work in the\ncase of quenched operators commuting with the unperturbed Hamiltonian. In the\ncommuting case the observables that we need to measure have an intuitive\nphysical meaning. Conversely in the non-commuting case, irrespectively of the\nsize of the quench, we show that it is possible to operate still with single\nprojective measurements but we derive an explicit expression for all the\ncumulants of the work that shows that physical properties are not so simply\ndecoded from those quantities. This circumstance makes the study of the physics\nof the system non-trivial as well as the emergence of thermodynamics from the\nfully quantum microscopic description. Interested in the criticality of a\nmany-body system, we illustrate our ideas with the example of the Ising model\nin a transverse field.\n'

S"  Noether's theorem is a fundamental result in physics stating that every\nsymmetry of the dynamics implies a conservation law. It is, however, deficient\nin several respects: (i) it is not applicable to dynamics wherein the system\ninteracts with an environment, and (ii) even in the case where the system is\nisolated, if the quantum state is mixed then the Noether conservation laws do\nnot capture all of the consequences of the symmetries. To address these\ndeficiencies, we introduce measures of the extent to which a quantum state\nbreaks a symmetry. Such measures yield novel constraints on state transitions:\nfor nonisolated systems, they cannot increase, while for isolated systems they\nare conserved. We demonstrate that the problem of finding nontrivial asymmetry\nmeasures can be solved using the tools of quantum information theory.\nApplications include deriving model-independent bounds on the quantum noise in\namplifiers and assessing quantum schemes for achieving high-precision\nmetrology.\n"

S'  A theoretical proposal for realizing and detecting spin supercurrent in an\nisotropic antiferromagnetic insulator is reported. Superfluid spin transport is\nachieved by inserting the antiferromagnet between two metallic reservoirs and\nestablishing a spin accumulation in one reservoir such that a spin bias is\napplied across the magnet. We consider a class of bipartite antiferromagnets\nwith Neel ground states, and temperatures well below the ordering temperature,\nwhere spin transport is mediated essentially by the condensate. Landau-Lifshitz\nand magneto-circuit theories are used to directly relate spin current in\ndifferent parts of the heterostructure to the spin-mixing conductances\ncharacterizing the antiferromagnet|metal interfaces and the antiferromagnet\nbulk damping parameters, quantities all obtainable from experiments. We study\nthe efficiency of spin angular-momentum transfer at an antiferromagnet|metal\ninterface by developing a microscopic scattering theory for the interface and\nextracting the spin-mixing conductance for a simple model. Within the model, a\nquantitative comparison between the spin-mixing conductances obtained for the\nantiferromagnet|metal and ferromagnet|metal interfaces is made.\n'

S'  Variable-amplitude oscillatory shear tests are emerging as powerful tools to\ninvestigate and quantify the nonlinear rheology of amorphous solids, complex\nfluids and biological materials. Quite a few recent experimental and atomistic\nsimulation studies demonstrated that at low shear amplitudes, an amorphous\nsolid settles into an amplitude- and initial conditions-dependent dissipative\nlimit cycle, in which back-and-forth localized particle rearrangements\nperiodically bring the system to the same state. At sufficiently large shear\namplitudes, the amorphous system loses memory of the initial conditions,\nexhibits chaotic particle motions accompanied by diffusive behavior and settles\ninto a stochastic steady-state. The two regimes are separated by a transition\namplitude, possibly characterized by some critical-like features. Here we argue\nthat these observations support some of the physical assumptions embodied in\nthe nonequilibrium thermodynamic, internal-variables based,\nShear-Transformation-Zone model of amorphous visco-plasticity; most notably\nthat "flow defects" in amorphous solids are characterized by internal states\nbetween which they can make transitions, and that structural evolution is\ndriven by dissipation associated with plastic deformation. We present a rather\nextensive theoretical analysis of the thermodynamic Shear-Transformation-Zone\nmodel for a variable-amplitude oscillatory shear protocol, highlighting its\nsuccess in accounting for various experimental and simulational observations,\nas well as its limitations. Our results offer a continuum-level theoretical\nframework for interpreting the variable-amplitude oscillatory shear response of\namorphous solids and may promote additional developments.\n'

S'  We consider the problem of inferring the conditional independence graph (CIG)\nof a multivariate stationary dicrete-time Gaussian random process based on a\nfinite length observation. Using information-theoretic methods, we derive a\nlower bound on the error probability of any learning scheme for the underlying\nprocess CIG. This bound, in turn, yields a minimum required sample-size which\nis necessary for any algorithm regardless of its computational complexity, to\nreliably select the true underlying CIG. Furthermore, by analysis of a simple\nselection scheme, we show that the information-theoretic limits can be achieved\nfor a subclass of processes having sparse CIG. We do not assume a parametric\nmodel for the observed process, but require it to have a sufficiently smooth\nspectral density matrix (SDM).\n'

S"  Silicene, a hexagonal buckled 2-D allotrope of silicon, shows potential as a\nplatform for numerous new applications, and may allow for easier integration\nwith existing silicon-based microelectronics than graphene. Here, we show that\nsilicene could function as an ultrafast electrical DNA sequencing device. We\ninvestigated the stability of this novel nano-bio system, its electronic\nproperties and the pronounced effects on the transverse electronic transport,\ni.e., changes in the transmission and the conductance caused by adsorption of\neach nucleobase, explored by us through the non-equilibrium Green's function\nmethod. Intriguingly, despite the relatively weak interaction between\nnucleobases and silicene, significant changes in the transmittance at zero bias\nare predicted by us, in particular for the two nucleobases cytosine and\nguanine. Our findings suggest that silicene could be utilized as an\nintegrated-circuit biosensor as part of a lab-on-a-chip device for DNA\nsequencing.\n"

This mapping is then exploited to optimize the dynamics and produce\nlarge amounts of entanglement distributed in very special ways.

S'  We report on the anomalous behavior of control pulses for spins subject to\nclassical noise with a singular autocorrelation function. This behavior is not\ndetected for noise with analytic autocorrelation functions. The effect is\nmanifest in the different scaling behavior of the deviation of a real pulse to\nthe ideal, instantaneous one. While a standard pulse displays scaling $\\propto\n\\tau_\\mathrm{p}^1$, a first-order refocusing pulse normally shows scaling\n$\\propto \\tau_\\mathrm{p}^2$. But in presence of cusps in the noise\nautocorrelation the scaling $\\propto \\tau_\\mathrm{p}^{3/2}$ occurs. Cusps in\nthe autocorrelation are characteristic for the omnipresent Ornstein-Uhlenbeck\nprocess. We prove that the anomalous exponent cannot be avoided; it represents\na fundamental limit. On the one hand, this redefines the strategies one has to\nadopt to design refocusing pulses. On the other hand, the anomalous exponent,\nif found in experiment, provides important information on the noise properties.\n'

S"  Entanglement measures such as the entanglement entropy have become an\nindispensable tool to identify the fundamental character of ground states of\ninteracting quantum many-body systems. For systems of interacting spin or\nbosonic degrees of freedom much recent progress has been made not only in the\nanalytical description of their respective entanglement entropies but also in\ntheir numerical classification. Systems of interacting fermionic degrees of\nfreedom however have proved to be more difficult to control, in particular with\nregard to the numerical understanding of their entanglement properties. Here we\nreport a generalization of the replica technique for the calculation of Renyi\nentropies to the framework of determinantal Quantum Monte Carlo simulations --\nthe numerical method of choice for unbiased, large-scale simulations of\ninteracting fermionic systems. We demonstrate the strength of this approach\nover a recent alternative proposal based on a decomposition in free fermion\nGreen's functions by studying the entanglement entropy of one-dimensional\nHubbard systems both at zero and finite temperatures.\n"

We give\nevidence that the magnitude of the largest anticipation time depends on the\ndynamical regime where the system operates (defect turbulence, phase turbulence\nor bichaos) and scales with the linear autocorrelation time of the system.\nMoreover, we find that the largest anticipation times are obtained for\ncomplex-valued coupling constants.

S'  Finding rare information hidden in a huge amount of data from the Internet is\na necessary but complex issue. Many researchers have studied this issue and\nhave found effective methods to detect anomaly data in low dimensional space.\nHowever, as the dimension increases, most of these existing methods perform\npoorly in detecting outliers because of "high dimensional curse". Even though\nsome approaches aim to solve this problem in high dimensional space, they can\nonly detect some anomaly data appearing in low dimensional space and cannot\ndetect all of anomaly data which appear differently in high dimensional space.\nTo cope with this problem, we propose a new k-nearest section-based method\n(k-NS) in a section-based space. Our proposed approach not only detects\noutliers in low dimensional space with section-density ratio but also detects\noutliers in high dimensional space with the ratio of k-nearest section against\naverage value. After taking a series of experiments with the dimension from 10\nto 10000, the experiment results show that our proposed method achieves 100%\nprecision and 100% recall result in the case of extremely high dimensional\nspace, and better improvement in low dimensional space compared to our\npreviously proposed method.\n'

S"  In this paper, a mathematical theory of learning is proposed that has many\nparallels with information theory. We consider Vapnik's General Setting of\nLearning in which the learning process is defined to be the act of selecting a\nhypothesis in response to a given training set. Such hypothesis can, for\nexample, be a decision boundary in classification, a set of centroids in\nclustering, or a set of frequent item-sets in association rule mining.\nDepending on the hypothesis space and how the final hypothesis is selected, we\nshow that a learning process can be assigned a numeric score, called learning\ncapacity, which is analogous to Shannon's channel capacity and satisfies\nsimilar interesting properties as well such as the data-processing inequality\nand the information-cannot-hurt inequality. In addition, learning capacity\nprovides the tightest possible bound on the difference between true risk and\nempirical risk of the learning process for all loss functions that are\nparametrized by the chosen hypothesis. It is also shown that the notion of\nlearning capacity equivalently quantifies how sensitive the choice of the final\nhypothesis is to a small perturbation in the training set. Consequently,\nalgorithmic stability is both necessary and sufficient for generalization.\nWhile the theory does not rely on concentration inequalities, we finally show\nthat analogs to classical results in learning theory using the Probably\nApproximately Correct (PAC) model can be immediately deduced using this theory,\nand conclude with information-theoretic bounds to learning capacity.\n"

The number of chiral Floquet Majorana edge states is confirmed\nby calculating Chern number analytically and energy spectrum in ribbon\ngeometry. Moreover, this proposal is generalized to other hexagonal lattice\nsystems, such as monolayer graphene and silicene. Notably, the parameter range\nof induced light to achieve the chiral Floquet Majorana edge states is\nexperimentally feasible, and the corresponding Floquet Majorana fermions can be\nprobed based on differential conductance using scanning tunneling spectroscopy.\n'

S'  We present a fast direct algorithm for computing symmetric factorizations,\ni.e. $A = WW^T$, of symmetric positive-definite hierarchical matrices with\nweak-admissibility conditions. The computational cost for the symmetric\nfactorization scales as $\\mathcal{O}(n \\log^2 n)$ for hierarchically\noff-diagonal low-rank matrices. Once this factorization is obtained, the cost\nfor inversion, application, and determinant computation scales as\n$\\mathcal{O}(n \\log n)$. In particular, this allows for the near optimal\ngeneration of correlated random variates in the case where $A$ is a covariance\nmatrix. This symmetric factorization algorithm depends on two key ingredients.\nFirst, we present a novel symmetric factorization formula for low-rank updates\nto the identity of the form $I+UKU^T$. This factorization can be computed in\n$\\mathcal{O}(n)$ time, if the rank of the perturbation is sufficiently small.\nSecond, combining this formula with a recursive divide-and-conquer strategy,\nnear linear complexity symmetric factorizations for hierarchically structured\nmatrices can be obtained. We present numerical results for matrices relevant to\nproblems in probability \\& statistics (Gaussian processes), interpolation\n(Radial basis functions), and Brownian dynamics calculations in fluid mechanics\n(the Rotne-Prager-Yamakawa tensor).\n'

S"  In graphene placed on hexagonal boron nitride, replicas of the original Dirac\nspectrum appear near edges of superlattice minibands. More such replicas\ndevelop in high magnetic fields, and their quantization gives rise to a fractal\npattern of Landau levels, referred to as the Hofstadter butterfly. Some\nevidence for the butterfly has recently been reported by using transport\nmeasurements. Here we employ capacitance spectroscopy to probe directly the\ndensity of states and energy gaps in graphene superlattices. Without magnetic\nfield, replica spectra are seen as pronounced minima in the density of states\nsurrounded by van Hove singularities. The Hofstadter butterfly shows up in\nmagnetocapacitance clearer than in transport measurements and, near one flux\nquantum per superlattice unit cell, we observe Landau fan diagrams related to\nquantization of Dirac replicas in a reduced magnetic field. Electron-electron\ninteraction strongly modifies the superlattice spectrum. In particular, we find\nthat graphene's quantum Hall ferromagnetism, due to lifted spin and valley\ndegeneracies, exhibits a reverse Stoner transition at commensurable fluxes and\nthat Landau levels of Dirac replicas support their own ferromagnetic states.\n"

We present a theory\nfor estimating $f_1$ in settings where $f_2(X_2)$ is more complex than\n$f_1(X_1)$. The proposed estimation procedure combines two least squares\ncriteria and can be written as an alternating projection procedure.

As an example we apply the results to an\nadditive model where the number of covariates is large or the nuisance\ncomponents are considerably less smooth than $f_1$.\n'

S'  There exist two scenarios of quantum weak measurement theories. One is the\nwell-known quantum trajectory theory which, in terms of continuous differential\nequation, has been broadly applied in quantum optics and quantum control\nproblems. Another is the relatively newer quantum Bayesian approach, which has\nthe advantage of being more efficient to infer the state of the measured\nquantum system merely based on certain integrated output of measurements. In\nthis work, we aim to develop a quantum Bayesian rule for weak measurements of\nqubits in circuit quantum electrodynamics (QED). Starting with the optical\nquantum trajectory equation, our analysis pays particular attention to the\nnature of the cavity field under continuous quadrature monitoring. This allows\nour treatment unrestricted to the "bad-cavity" and weak-response limits, thus\nmaking the obtained rule applicable to general setup parameters. With accuracy\nwell proven numerically in this work, we expect this proposed approach to be\nuseful for future circuit-QED measurement and control experiments.\n'

S'  Several sensing concepts using nanostructures prepared by focused electron\nbeam induced deposition have been developed over the last years. Following work\non highly miniaturized Hall sensors for magnetic sensing with soft magnetic Co,\nstrain and force sensing based on nano-granular platinum-carbon structures\n(Pt(C)) was introduced. Very recently the capability of nano-granular Pt(C)\nstructures to detect the presence of adsorbate water layers by conductance\nmodulations was demonstrated. For magnetic and strain sensing the underlying\nphysical mechanisms of the sensing effect have been analyzed in detail and are\nnow quite well understood. This is not the case for the adsorbate layer induced\nconductance modulation effect. Here we provide a theoretical framework that\nallows for a semi-quantitative understanding of the observed water-sensing\neffect. We show how the near-interface renormalization of the Coulomb charging\nenergy in the nano-granular metal caused by the dielectric screening of the\npolarizable adsorbate layer leads to a conductance modulation. The model can\naccount for the conductance modulation observed in the water adsorbate\nexperiments and can also be applied to understand similar effects caused by\nnear-interface dielectric anomalies of ferroelectric thin films on top of\nnano-granular Pt(C). Our findings provide a pathway towards optimized\nnano-granular layer structures suitable for a wide range of dielectric or local\npotential sensing applications.\n'

S'  In this paper, we study the problem of learning a monotone DNF with at most\n$s$ terms of size (number of variables in each term) at most $r$ ($s$ term\n$r$-MDNF) from membership queries. This problem is equivalent to the problem of\nlearning a general hypergraph using hyperedge-detecting queries, a problem\nmotivated by applications arising in chemical reactions and genome sequencing.\n  We first present new lower bounds for this problem and then present\ndeterministic and randomized adaptive algorithms with query complexities that\nare almost optimal. All the algorithms we present in this paper run in time\nlinear in the query complexity and the number of variables $n$. In addition,\nall of the algorithms we present in this paper are asymptotically tight for\nfixed $r$ and/or $s$.\n'

S"  Separating an image into cartoon and texture components comes useful in image\nprocessing applications, such as image compression, image segmentation, image\ninpainting. Yves Meyer's influential cartoon texture decomposition model\ninvolves deriving an energy functional by choosing appropriate spaces and\nfunctionals. Minimizers of the derived energy functional are cartoon and\ntexture components of an image. In this study, cartoon part of an image is\nseparated, by reconstructing it from pixels of multi scale Total-Variation\nfiltered versions of the original image which is sought to be decomposed into\ncartoon and texture parts. An information theoretic pixel by pixel selection\ncriteria is employed to choose the contributing pixels and their scales.\n"

S'  In binary classification and regression problems, it is well understood that\nLipschitz continuity and smoothness of the loss function play key roles in\ngoverning generalization error bounds for empirical risk minimization\nalgorithms. In this paper, we show how these two properties affect\ngeneralization error bounds in the learning to rank problem. The learning to\nrank problem involves vector valued predictions and therefore the choice of the\nnorm with respect to which Lipschitz continuity and smoothness are defined\nbecomes crucial. Choosing the $\\ell_\\infty$ norm in our definition of Lipschitz\ncontinuity allows us to improve existing bounds. Furthermore, under smoothness\nassumptions, our choice enables us to prove rates that interpolate between\n$1/\\sqrt{n}$ and $1/n$ rates. Application of our results to ListNet, a popular\nlearning to rank method, gives state-of-the-art performance guarantees.\n'

S'  A new approach to maximum likelihood learning of discrete graphical models\nand RBM in particular is introduced. Our method, Perturb and Descend (PD) is\ninspired by two ideas (I) perturb and MAP method for sampling (II) learning by\nContrastive Divergence minimization. In contrast to perturb and MAP, PD\nleverages training data to learn the models that do not allow efficient MAP\nestimation. During the learning, to produce a sample from the current model, we\nstart from a training data and descend in the energy landscape of the\n"perturbed model", for a fixed number of steps, or until a local optima is\nreached. For RBM, this involves linear calculations and thresholding which can\nbe very fast. Furthermore we show that the amount of perturbation is closely\nrelated to the temperature parameter and it can regularize the model by\nproducing robust features resulting in sparse hidden layer activation.\n'

In this paper we use the newly developed DG method to\nsolve a mathematical model for early stages of atherosclerotic plaque\nformation. Atherosclerotic plaque is mainly formed by accumulation of\nlipid-laden cells in the arterial walls which leads to a heart attack in case\nthe artery is occluded or a thrombus is built through a rupture of the plaque.\nAfter describing a mathematical model and the discretization scheme, we present\nsome benchmark tests comparing the CDG2 method to other commonly used DG\nmethods. Furthermore, we take parallelization and higher order discretization\nschemes into account.\n'

S"  The homogenization of auxetic cellular solids having periodic hexachiral and\ntetrachiral microstructure is dealt with two different techniques. The first\napproach is based on the representation of the cellular solid as a beam-lattice\nto be homogenized as a micropolar continuum. The second approach is developed\nto analyse periodic cells conceived as a two-dimensional domain consisting of\ndeformable portions such as the ring, the ligaments and possibly an embedded\nmatrix internally to these. This approach is based on a second displacement\ngradient computational homogenization proposed by the Authors (Bacigalupo and\nGambarotta, 2010). The elastic moduli obtained by the micropolar homogenization\nare expressed in analytical form from which it appears explicitly their\ndependence on the parameter of chirality, which is the angle of inclination of\nthe ligaments with respect to the grid of lines connecting the centers of the\nrings. For hexachiral cells, the solution of Liu et al., 2012, is found,\nshowing the auxetic property of the lattice together with the elastic coupling\nmodulus between the normal and the asymmetric strains; a property that has been\nconfirmed here for the tetrachiral lattice. Unlike the hexagonal lattice, the\nclassical constitutive equations of the tetragonal lattice turns out to be\ncharacterized by the coupling between the normal and shear strains through an\nelastic modulus that is an odd function of the parameter of chirality.\nMoreover, this lattice is found to exhibit a remarkable variability of the\nYoung's modulus and of the Poisson's ratio with the direction of the applied\nuniaxial stress. The properties of the equivalent micropolar continuum are\nqualitatively detected also in the equivalent second-gradient continuum.\n"

Strong convergence results are\npresented for the case of locally Lipschitz coefficients.

S'  In this paper, we develop parametrized positivity satisfying flux limiters\nfor the high order finite difference Runge-Kutta weighted essentially\nnon-oscillatory (WENO) scheme solving compressible Euler equations to maintain\npositive density and pressure. Negative density and pressure, which often leads\nto simulation blow-ups or nonphysical solutions, emerges from many high\nresolution computations in some extreme cases. The methodology we propose in\nthis paper is a nontrivial generalization of the parametrized maximum principle\npreserving flux limiters for high order finite difference schemes solving\nscalar hyperbolic conservation laws [22, 10, 20]. To preserve the maximum\nprinciple, the high order flux is limited towards a first order monotone flux,\nwhere the limiting procedures are designed by decoupling linear maximum\nprinciple constraints. High order schemes with such flux limiters are shown to\npreserve the high order accuracy via local truncation error analysis and by\nextensive numerical experiments with mild CFL constraints. The parametrized\nflux limiting approach is generalized to the Euler system to preserve the\npositivity of density and pressure of numerical solutions via decoupling some\nnonlinear constraints. Compared with existing high order positivity preserving\napproaches [24, 26, 25], our proposed algorithm is positivity preserving by the\ndesign; it is computationally efficient and maintains high order spatial and\ntemporal accuracy in our extensive numerical tests. Numerical tests are\nperformed to demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed new\nalgorithm.\n'

S'  We describe a new method for superresolution of still images (in the wavelet\ndomain) based on the reconstruction of missing details subbands pixels at a\ngiven ith level via Rule of Three (Ro3) between pixels of approximation subband\nof such level, and pixels of approximation and detail subbands of (i+1)th\nlevel. The histogramic profiles demonstrate that Ro3 is the appropriate\nmechanism to recover missing detail subband pixels in these cases. Besides,\nwith the elimination of the details subbands pixels (in an eventual compression\nscheme), we obtain a bigger compression rate. Experimental results demonstrate\nthat our approach compares favorably to more typical methods of denoising and\ncompression in wavelet domain. Our method does not compress, but facilitates\nthe action of the real compressor, in our case, Joint Photographic Experts\nGroup (JPEG) and JPEg2000, that is, Ro3 acts as a catalyst compression\n'

S'  In this chapter a general mathematical model of Optical Coherence Tomography\n(OCT) is presented on the basis of the electromagnetic theory. OCT produces\nhigh resolution images of the inner structure of biological tissues. Images are\nobtained by measuring the time delay and the intensity of the backscattered\nlight from the sample considering also the coherence properties of light. The\nscattering problem is considered for a weakly scattering medium located far\nenough from the detector. The inverse problem is to reconstruct the\nsusceptibility of the medium given the measurements for different positions of\nthe mirror. Different approaches are addressed depending on the different\nassumptions made about the optical properties of the sample. This procedure is\napplied to a full field OCT system and an extension to standard (time and\nfrequency domain) OCT is briefly presented.\n'

S"  Accurate upper-lower bounds on homogenized matrix, arising from the unit cell\nproblem for periodic media, are calculated for a scalar elliptic setting. Our\napproach builds on the recent variational reformulation of the Moulinec-Suquet\n(1994) Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) homogenization scheme by Vond\\v{r}ejc et\nal. (2014), which is based on the conforming Galerkin approximation with\ntrigonometric polynomials. Upper-lower bounds are obtained by adjusting the\nprimal-dual finite element framework developed independently by Dvo\\v{r}\\'{a}k\n(1993) and Wi\\c{e}ckowski (1995) to the FFT-based Galerkin setting. We show\nthat the discretization procedure differs for odd and non-odd number of\ndiscretization points. In particular, thanks to the Helmholtz decomposition\ninherited from the continuous formulation, the duality structure is fully\nrecovered for odd discretization. In the latter case, the more complex\nprimal-dual structure is observed due to the trigonometric polynomials\nassociated with the Nyquist frequencies. These theoretical findings are\nconfirmed with numerical examples. To conclude, the main advantage of the\nFFT-based approach over the two finite-element schemes of Dvo\\v{r}\\'{a}k and\nWi\\c{e}ckowski is that the primal and the dual problems can be treated on the\nsame basis, and this property can be extended beyond the scalar elliptic\nproblem.\n"

S'  We derive a nonparametric test for constant (continuous) beta over a fixed\ninterval of time. Continuous beta is defined as the ratio of the continuous\ncovariation between an asset and observable risk factor (e.g., the market\nreturn) and the continuous variation of the latter. Our test is based on\ndiscrete observations of a bivariate \\Ito semimartingale with mesh of the\nobservation grid shrinking to zero. We first form a consistent and\nasymptotically mixed normal estimate of beta using all the observations within\nthe time interval under the null hypothesis that beta is constant. Using it we\nform an estimate of the residual component of the asset returns that is\northogonal (in martingale sense) to the risk factor. Our test is then based on\nthe distinctive asymptotic behavior, under the null and alternative hypothesis,\nof the sample covariation between the risk factor and the estimated residual\ncomponent of the asset returns over blocks with asymptotically shrinking time\nspan. We document satisfactory finite sample properties of the test on\nsimulated data. In an empirical application based on 10-minute data we analyze\nthe time variation in market betas of four assets over the period\n$2006$--$2012$. The results suggest that (for likely structural reasons) for\none of the assets there is statistically nontrivial variation in market beta\neven for a period as short as a week. On the other hand, for the rest of the\nassets in our analysis we find evidence that a window of constant beta of one\nweek to one month is statistically plausible.\n'

We show that given a\nnonnegative real matrix $A$, a $\\sigma\\geq\\rho(A)$ and a vector $\\boldsymbol\nw>0$ such that $A\\boldsymbol w\\leq\\sigma\\boldsymbol w$, every iteration of\nstep-asynchronous successive overrelaxation for the problem $(sI- A)\\boldsymbol\nx=\\boldsymbol b$, with $s >\\sigma$, reduces geometrically the $\\boldsymbol\nw$-norm of the current error by a factor that we can compute explicitly.

This property makes it possible to estimate the\nsupremum norm of the absolute error at each iteration without any additional\nhypothesis on $A$, even when $A$ is so large that computing the product\n$A\\boldsymbol x$ is feasible, but estimating the supremum norm of $(sI-A)^{-1}$\nis not.\n'

S'  In the presence of axial magnetic fields, which can be realized in\ndeliberately buckled monolayer graphene, quasi-relativistic Dirac fermions can\nfind themselves in various broken symmetry phases even for weak interactions.\nThrough a detailed Hartree self-consistent numerical calculation in finite\nstrained graphene, with cylindrical and open boundaries, we establish the\npossibility of realizing a charge-density-wave order for the spinless fermions\nin the presence of weak nearest-neighbor repulsion. Such an instability gives\nrise to a staggered pattern of average fermionic density between the the bulk\nand the edge of the system, as well as among the two sublattices of graphene,\ndue to the spatial separation of the zero energy states, localized on two\ndistinct sublattices. Although with fermions spin restored, an unconventional\nmagnetic order, driven by the onsite repulsion, possibly leads to the dominant\ninstability at the Dirac point, the proposed charge-density-wave order can,\nnevertheless, be realized at finite doping, which is always accompanied by a\nfinite ferromagnetic moment. Additionally, the charge-density-wave phase\nsupports a quantized charge or spin Hall conductivity, when its formation away\nfrom the Dirac point, is preceded by the appearance of topological anomalous or\nspin Hall insulator, on the other hand supported by the second neighbor\nrepulsion, respectively. Therefore, depending on the relative strength of\nvarious short-ranged components of the Coulomb interaction, a variety of broken\nsymmetry phases can be realized within the zero energy manifold in strained\ngraphene.\n'

S'  Similarity comparisons of the form "Is object a more similar to b than to c?"\nare useful for computer vision and machine learning applications.\nUnfortunately, an embedding of $n$ points is specified by $n^3$ triplets,\nmaking collecting every triplet an expensive task. In noticing this difficulty,\nother researchers have investigated more intelligent triplet sampling\ntechniques, but they do not study their effectiveness or their potential\ndrawbacks. Although it is important to reduce the number of collected triplets,\nit is also important to understand how best to display a triplet collection\ntask to a user. In this work we explore an alternative display for collecting\ntriplets and analyze the monetary cost and speed of the display. We propose\nbest practices for creating cost effective human intelligence tasks for\ncollecting triplets. We show that rather than changing the sampling algorithm,\nsimple changes to the crowdsourcing UI can lead to much higher quality\nembeddings. We also provide a dataset as well as the labels collected from\ncrowd workers.\n'

For ellipsoids, we provide a bound in terms\nof the distance between these ellipsoids and simple functions of their\npolynomial coefficients. As an application, this theorem provides bounds for\ncompressive classification of convex sets. Rather than assuming that the data\nto be classified is sparse, our results show that the data can be acquired via\nvery few measurements yet will remain linearly separable.

S'  Condensation of fluctuations is an interesting phenomenon conceptually\ndistinct from condensation on average. One stricking feature is that, contrary\nto what happens on average, condensation of fluctuations may occurr even in the\nabsence of interaction. The explanation emerges from the duality between large\ndeviation events in the given system and typical events in a new and\nappropriately biased system. This surprising phenomenon is investigated in the\ncontext of the Gaussian model, chosen as paradigmatical non interacting system,\nbefore and after an istantaneous temperature quench. It is shown that the bias\ninduces a mean-field-like effective interaction responsible of the condensation\non average. Phase diagrams, covering both the equilibrium and the\noff-equilibrium regimes, are derived for observables representative of generic\nbehaviors.\n'

S"  We probe the complex rheology of nearly ideal 3d foam by flowing through a\nnarrow column. The foams we investigate have large bubble size, to minimize the\neffects of coarsening, and are very dry. Foams of this type cannot be studied\nvia conventional rheometry. The foam flows upward through a vertical\nrectangular column with a 4:1 cross-sectional aspect ratio, by bubbling gas\nthrough a soapy solution at the base of our apparatus. At the column's narrow\nsurfaces are sticky boundaries, which create shear due to the zero velocity\nboundary condition. As expected, the flow profile between the adjacent slippery\nbroad faces is flat, however the profile between the narrow, sticky faces\nexhibits a curved velocity profile that is dependent on gas flow rate. We are\nable to analyze a 2d velocity profile from a 3d bulk system. We employ particle\nimage velocimetry to measure the strain rate, and compute the stress from the\npressure drop along the channel, to investigate the local stress-strain\nrelationships in a flowing foam. We find these dry foams to have a\nHershel-Bulkley exponent of 0.21, which is significantly lower (more shear\nthinning) than other results shown in the literature for much wetter foams.\n"

S'  We present nonlinear dielectric measurements of glass-forming 1-propanol, a\nprototypical example for the monohydroxy alcohols that are known to exhibit\nunusual relaxation dynamics, namely an additional Debye relaxation, slower than\nthe structural alpha relaxation. Applying high ac fields of 468 kV/cm allows\nfor a detailed investigation of the nonlinear properties of all three\nrelaxation processes occurring in 1-propanol, namely the Debye, alpha, and beta\nrelaxation. Both the field-induced variations of dielectric constant and loss\nare reported. Polarization saturation and the absorption of field energy govern\nthe findings in the Debye-relaxation regime, well consistent with the suggested\ncluster-like nature of the relaxing entities. The behavior of the alpha\nrelaxation is in good accord with the expectations for a heterogeneous\nrelaxation scenario. Finally, the Johari-Goldstein beta-relaxation in\n1-propanol seems to exhibit no or only weak field dependence, in agreement with\nrecent findings for the excess wing of canonical glass formers.\n'

S'  We discuss methodological issues related to the evaluation of unsupervised\nbinary code construction methods for nearest neighbor search. These issues have\nbeen widely ignored in literature. These coding methods attempt to preserve\neither Euclidean distance or angular (cosine) distance in the binary embedding\nspace. We explain why when comparing a method whose goal is preserving cosine\nsimilarity to one designed for preserving Euclidean distance, the original\nfeatures should be normalized by mapping them to the unit hypersphere before\nlearning the binary mapping functions. To compare a method whose goal is to\npreserves Euclidean distance to one that preserves cosine similarity, the\noriginal feature data must be mapped to a higher dimension by including a bias\nterm in binary mapping functions. These conditions ensure the fair comparison\nbetween different binary code methods for the task of nearest neighbor search.\nOur experiments show under these conditions the very simple methods (e.g. LSH\nand ITQ) often outperform recent state-of-the-art methods (e.g. MDSH and\nOK-means).\n'

S'  We report low temperature scanning tunneling microscopy characterization of\nMoSe2 crystals, and the fabrication and electrical characterization of MoSe2\nfield-effect transistors on both SiO2 and parylene-C substrates. We find that\nthe multilayer MoSe2 devices on parylene-C show a room temperature mobility\nclose to the mobility of bulk MoSe2 (100 cm2V-1s-1 - 160 cm2V-1s-1), which is\nsignificantly higher than that on SiO2 substrate (~50 cm2V-1s-1). The room\ntemperature mobility on both types of substrates are nearly thickness\nindependent. Our variable temperature transport measurements reveal a\nmetal-insulator transition at a characteristic conductivity of e2/h. The\nmobility of MoSe2 devices extracted from the metallic region on both SiO2 and\nparylene-C increases up to ~ 500 cm2V-1s-1 as the temperature decreases to ~\n100 K, with the mobility of MoSe2 on SiO2 increasing more rapidly. In spite of\nthe notable variation of charged impurities as indicated by the strongly sample\ndependent low temperature mobility, the mobility of all MoSe2 devices on SiO2\nconverges above 200 K, indicating that the high temperature (> 200 K) mobility\nin these devices is nearly independent of the charged impurities. Our atomic\nforce microscopy study of SiO2 and parylene-C substrates further rule out the\nsurface roughness scattering as a major cause of the substrate dependent\nmobility. We attribute the observed substrate dependence of MoSe2 mobility\nprimarily to the surface polar optical phonon scattering originating from the\nSiO2 substrate, which is nearly absent in MoSe2 devices on parylene-C\nsubstrate.\n'

S"  The supercooled liquid silicon, modeled by Stillinger-Weber potential, shows\nanomalous increase in heat capacity $C_p$, with a maximum $C_p$ value close to\n1060 K at zero pressure. We study equilibration and relaxation of the\nsupercooled SW Si, in the temperature range of 1060 K--1070 K at zero pressure.\nWe find that as the relaxation of the metastable supercooled liquid phase\ninitiates, a straight line region (SLR) is formed in cumulative potential\nenergy distributions. The configurational temperature corresponding to the SLR\nis close to 1060 K, which was earlier identified as the freezing temperature of\n4-coordinated amorphous network. The SLR is found to be tangential to the\ndistribution of the metastable liquid phase and thus influences the broadness\nof the distribution. As the bath temperature is reduced from 1070 K to 1060 K,\nthe effective temperature approaches the bath temperature which results in\nbroadening of the metastable phase distribution. This, in turn, causes an\nincrease in overall fluctuations of potential energy and hence an increase of\nheat capacity. We also find that during initial stages of relaxation,\n4-coordinated atoms form 6-membered rings with a chair--like structure and\nother structural units that indicate crystallization. Simultaneously a strong\ncorrelation is established between the number of chair-shaped 6-membered rings\nand the number of 4-coordinated atoms in the system. This shows that all\nproperties related to 4-coordinated particles are highly correlated as the SLR\nis formed in potential energy distributions and this can be interpreted as a\nconsequence of `freezing' of amorphous network formed by 4-coordinated\nparticles.\n"

S'  Network infrastructures are essential for the distribution of resources such\nas electricity and water. Typical strategies to assess their resilience focus\non the impact of a sequence of random or targeted failures of network nodes or\nlinks. Here we consider a more realistic scenario, where elements fail based on\ntheir usage. We propose a dynamic model of transport based on the\nBak-Tang-Wiesenfeld sandpile model where links fail after they have transported\nmore than an amount $\\mu$ (threshold) of the resource and we investigate it on\nthe square lattice. We observe that for low values of the threshold due to a\npositive feedback of link failure, an avalanche develops that leads to an\nabrupt collapse of the lattice. By contrast, for high thresholds the lattice\nbreaks down in an uncorrelated fashion. We determine the critical threshold\n$\\mu^*$ separating these two regimes and show how the time of the abrupt\ncollapse scales with lattice size and threshold $\\mu$. Furthermore, we propose\na lower bound for $\\mu^*$ by measuring the strength of the dynamics leading to\nabrupt collapses.\n'

S'  Several explanations can be found in the literature on how colorectal cancer\nbegins. There is however some agreement on the fact that its carcinogenic\nprocess is a result of several genetic mutations of normal cells. The colon\nepithelium is characterized by millions of invaginations, very small cavities,\ncalled crypts, where most of the cellular activity occurs. It is consensual in\nthe medical community, that a potential first manifestation of the carcinogenic\nprocess, observed in colonoscopy, is the appearance of Aberrant Crypt Foci\n(ACF). These are clusters of abnormal crypts, whose morphological\ncharacteristics are a consequence of an atypical behavior of the cells that\npopulate the crypts. In this work an homogenization model is proposed, for\nrepresenting the cellular dynamics in the colon epithelium, with the intention\nof simulating and predicting, {\\it in silico}, the spread and evolution of ACF,\nas it can be observed in colonoscopy. By assuming that the colon is an\nheterogeneous media, exhibiting a periodic distribution of very small cavities\n(the crypts), we first describe a periodic model that we have introduced\nrecently, for describing the ACF cell-dynamics in a two-dimensional setting.\nThen, to this periodic model, homogenization techniques are applied, to find a\nsimpler model, whose solution symbolizes the averaged behavior of ACF. Some\ntheoretical results concerning the existence of solution of the homogenized\nmodel are proven, applying a fixed point theorem. Numerical results showing the\nconvergence of the periodic model to the homogenized one are also presented.\n'

The stationary probability\ndistributions can be derived from a simple diffusion equation in the presence\nof an inhomogeneous effective temperature resulting from the action of external\nforce fields. In particular, transitions rates over asymmetric energy barriers\ncan be unbalanced by having two different effective temperatures over the two\nslopes of the barrier. By varying the type of active noise, we find that equal\nvalues of diffusivity and persistence time may produce strongly varied\neffective temperatures and thus stationary distributions.\n'

S'  Complex networks grow subject to structural constraints which affect their\nmeasurable properties. Assessing the effect that such constraints impose on\ntheir observables is thus a crucial aspect to be taken into account in their\nanalysis. To this end,we examine the effect of fixing the strength sequence in\nmulti-edge networks on several network observables such as degrees, disparity,\naverage neighbor properties and weight distribution using an ensemble approach.\nWe provide a general method to calculate any desired weighted network metric\nand we show that several features detected in real data could be explained\nsolely by structural constraints. We thus justify the need of analytical null\nmodels to be used as basis to assess the relevance of features found in real\ndata represented in weighted network form.\n'

S'  The Barab\\\'asi-Bianconi (BB) fitness model can be solved by a mapping between\nthe original network growth model to an idealized bosonic gas. The well-known\ntransition to Bose-Einstein condensation in the latter then corresponds to the\nemergence of "super-hubs" in the network model. Motivated by the preservation\nof the scale-free property, thermodynamic stability and self-duality, we\ngeneralize the original extensive mapping of the BB fitness model by using the\nnonextensive Kaniadakis k-distribution. Through numerical simulation and\nmean-field calculations we show that deviations from extensivity do not\ncompromise qualitative features of the phase transition. Analysis of the\ncritical temperature yields a monotonically decreasing dependence on the\nnonextensive parameter k.\n'

S"  Social media has been considered as a data source for tracking disease.\nHowever, most analyses are based on models that prioritize strong correlation\nwith population-level disease rates over determining whether or not specific\nindividual users are actually sick. Taking a different approach, we develop a\nnovel system for social-media based disease detection at the individual level\nusing a sample of professionally diagnosed individuals. Specifically, we\ndevelop a system for making an accurate influenza diagnosis based on an\nindividual's publicly available Twitter data. We find that about half (17/35 =\n48.57%) of the users in our sample that were sick explicitly discuss their\ndisease on Twitter. By developing a meta classifier that combines text\nanalysis, anomaly detection, and social network analysis, we are able to\ndiagnose an individual with greater than 99% accuracy even if she does not\ndiscuss her health.\n"

S'  This paper addresses the problem of identifying a very small subset of data\npoints that belong to a significantly larger massive dataset (i.e., Big Data).\nThe small number of selected data points must adequately represent and\nfaithfully characterize the massive Big Data. Such identification process is\nknown as representative selection [19]. We propose a novel representative\nselection framework by generating an l1 norm sparse graph for a given Big-Data\ndataset. The Big Data is partitioned recursively into clusters using a spectral\nclustering algorithm on the generated sparse graph. We consider each cluster as\none point in a Grassmann manifold, and measure the geodesic distance among\nthese points. The distances are further analyzed using a min-max algorithm [1]\nto extract an optimal subset of clusters. Finally, by considering a sparse\nsubgraph of each selected cluster, we detect a representative using principal\ncomponent centrality [11]. We refer to the proposed representative selection\nframework as a Sparse Graph and Grassmann Manifold (SGGM) based approach. To\nvalidate the proposed SGGM framework, we apply it onto the problem of video\nsummarization where only few video frames, known as key frames, are selected\namong a much longer video sequence. A comparison of the results obtained by the\nproposed algorithm with the ground truth, which is agreed by multiple human\njudges, and with some state-of-the-art methods clearly indicates the viability\nof the SGGM framework.\n'

S'  Analysis of high dimensional noisy data is of essence across a variety of\nresearch fields. Feature selection techniques are designed to find the relevant\nfeature subset that can facilitate classification or pattern detection.\nTraditional (supervised) feature selection methods utilize label information to\nguide the identification of relevant feature subsets. In this paper, however,\nwe consider the unsupervised feature selection problem. Without the label\ninformation, it is particularly difficult to identify a small set of relevant\nfeatures due to the noisy nature of real-world data which corrupts the\nintrinsic structure of the data. Our Gradient-based Laplacian Feature Selection\n(GLFS) selects important features by minimizing the variance of the Laplacian\nregularized least squares regression model. With $\\ell_1$ relaxation, GLFS can\nfind a sparse subset of features that is relevant to the Laplacian manifolds.\nExtensive experiments on simulated, three real-world object recognition and two\ncomputational biology datasets, have illustrated the power and superior\nperformance of our approach over multiple state-of-the-art unsupervised feature\nselection methods. Additionally, we show that GLFS selects a sparser set of\nmore relevant features in a supervised setting outperforming the popular\nelastic net methodology.\n'

S'  We study records generated by Brownian particles in one dimension.\nSpecifically, we investigate an ordinary random walk and define the record as\nthe maximal position of the walk. We compare the record of an individual random\nwalk with the mean record, obtained as an average over infinitely many\nrealizations. We term the walk "superior" if the record is always above\naverage, and conversely, the walk is said to be "inferior" if the record is\nalways below average. We find that the fraction of superior walks, S, decays\nalgebraically with time, S ~ t^(-beta), in the limit t --> infty, and that the\npersistence exponent is nontrivial, beta=0.382258.... The fraction of inferior\nwalks, I, also decays as a power law, I ~ t^(-alpha), but the persistence\nexponent is smaller, alpha=0.241608.... Both exponents are roots of\ntranscendental equations involving the parabolic cylinder function. To obtain\nthese theoretical results, we analyze the joint density of superior walks with\ngiven record and position, while for inferior walks it suffices to study the\ndensity as function of position.\n'

S'  Ordinary differential equations (ODEs) are used to model dynamic systems\nappearing in engineering, physics, biomedical sciences and many other fields.\nThese equations contain unknown parameters, say $\\theta$ of physical\nsignificance which have to be estimated from the noisy data. Often there is no\nclosed form analytic solution of the equations and hence we cannot use the\nusual non-linear least squares technique to estimate the unknown parameters.\nThere is a two step approach to solve this problem, where the first step\ninvolves fitting the data nonparametrically. In the second step the parameter\nis estimated by minimizing the distance between the nonparametrically estimated\nderivative and the derivative suggested by the system of ODEs. The statistical\naspects of this approach have been studied under the frequentist framework. We\nconsider this two step estimation under the Bayesian framework. The response\nvariable is allowed to be multidimensional and the true mean function of it is\nnot assumed to be in the model. We induce a prior on the regression function\nusing a random series based on the B-spline basis functions. We establish the\nBernstein-von Mises theorem for the posterior distribution of the parameter of\ninterest. Interestingly, even though the posterior distribution of the\nregression function based on splines converges at a rate slower than\n$n^{-1/2}$, the parameter vector $\\theta$ is nevertheless estimated at\n$n^{-1/2}$ rate.\n'

S'  Optomechanical systems provide a unique platform for observing quantum\nbehavior of macroscopic objects. However, efforts towards realizing nonlinear\nbehavior at the single photon level have been inhibited by the small size of\nthe radiation pressure interaction. Here we show that is possible to realize\nsignificant optomechanical nonlinearities at the few quanta level in a strongly\ndriven two-mode optomechanical system. In particular, as the strength of the\ndriving laser increases the energy of one of the optomechanical normal modes\napproaches zero and the associated harmonic oscillator length becomes large.\nThis leads to an enhanced single photon optomechanical coupling, scaling with\nthe sideband resolution of the mechanics. We show that this could be measured\nin two-photon correlations when the system is in the side-band resolved regime\nwith relatively large single-photon optomechanical coupling. These conditions\nare within the reach of current devices.\n'

S'  There has been great interest in two-dimensional materials, beyond graphene,\nfor both fundamental sciences and technological applications. Silicene, a\nsilicon counterpart of graphene, has been shown to possess some better\nelectronic properties than graphene. However, its thermal transport properties\nhave not been fully studied. In this paper, we apply the first-principles-based\nphonon Boltzmann transport equation formalism to investigate the thermal\nconductivity of silicene. Although both graphene and silicene are\ntwo-dimensional crystals with similar crystal structure, we find that phonon\ntransport in silicene is quite different from that in graphene. The thermal\nconductivity of silicene shows a logarithmic increase with respect to the\nsample size due to the small scattering rates of acoustic in-plane phonon\nmodes, while that of graphene is finite. Detailed analysis of phonon scattering\nchannels shows that the linear dispersion of the acoustic out-of-plane (ZA)\nphonon modes, which is induced by the buckled structure, makes the\nlong-wavelength longitudinal acoustic (LA) phonon modes in silicene not as\nefficiently scattered as that in graphene. Compared with graphene, where most\nof the heat is carried by the acoustic out-of-plane (ZA) phonon modes, the ZA\nphonon modes in silicene only have ~10% contribution to the total thermal\nconductivity, which can also be attributed to the buckled structure. This\nsystematic comparison of phonon transport and thermal conductivity using the\nfirst-principle-based calculations shed some light on other two-dimensional\nmaterials, such as two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides.\n'

DCA is a local continuous approach to solve a wide\nvariety of nonconvex programs for which it provided quite often a global\nsolution and proved to be more robust and efficient than standard methods.\nPreliminary comparative results of DCA and a classical Branch-and-Bound\nalgorithm will be presented.

Since in typical method the porogens are solved in the solution\nand flow with the polymers during the casting and the crystallinity behavior of\nPLA chains in the limited space cannot be tracked, in this work the processing\nis modified by diffusing the PLA solution into a steady salt stack. With a\nthermal treatment before leaching while maintaining the stable structure of the\nporogens stack, the crystallinity of porous foams is made possible to control.\nThe characterizations indicate the crystallization of porous foams is in a\nmanner of lower crystallibility than the bulk materials. Pores and caves of\naround 250{\\mu}m size are obtained in samples with different crystallinity. The\nmacro-structures are not much impaired by the crystallization nevertheless the\nmorphological effect of the heating process is still obvious.\n'

S'  Quantum electro-mechanical systems offer a unique opportunity to probe\nquantum noise properties in macroscopic devices, properties which ultimately\nstem from the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. A simple example of this is\nexpected to occur in a microwave parametric transducer, where mechanical motion\ngenerates motional sidebands corresponding to the up and down\nfrequency-conversion of microwave photons. Due to quantum vacuum noise, the\nrates of these processes are expected to be unequal. We measure this\nfundamental imbalance in a microwave transducer coupled to a radio-frequency\nmechanical mode, cooled near the ground state of motion. We also discuss the\nsubtle origin of this imbalance: depending on the measurement scheme, the\nimbalance is most naturally attributed to the quantum fluctuations of either\nthe mechanical mode or of the electromagnetic field.\n'

The formalism combines Floquet\ntheory with a generalized master equation approach. For a driven two-level\nsystem and in the long-time limit, we obtain a universal expression for the\ndistribution, providing clear physical insight into the exchanged energy\nquanta. We illustrate our approach in two analytically solvable cases and\ndiscuss the differences in the corresponding distributions.

The\nstudy of the dynamics of supercooled liquids with this type of quenched\ndisorder has drawn a lot of attention in recent years due to theoretical\npredictions of the possibility of observing the ideal thermodynamic glass\ntransition in such systems. In this Letter, we numerically examine this\npossibility by determining the phase diagram of the systems in the\n$\\rho_{pin}-T$ plane. We find that the phase diagram differs considerably from\nexisting theoretical predictions and show that a rapid decrease in the kinetic\nfragility of the system with increasing pin concentration is a probable reason\nfor this difference.\n'

S'  In this work, we propose a very simple deep learning network for image\nclassification which comprises only the very basic data processing components:\ncascaded principal component analysis (PCA), binary hashing, and block-wise\nhistograms. In the proposed architecture, PCA is employed to learn multistage\nfilter banks. It is followed by simple binary hashing and block histograms for\nindexing and pooling. This architecture is thus named as a PCA network (PCANet)\nand can be designed and learned extremely easily and efficiently. For\ncomparison and better understanding, we also introduce and study two simple\nvariations to the PCANet, namely the RandNet and LDANet. They share the same\ntopology of PCANet but their cascaded filters are either selected randomly or\nlearned from LDA. We have tested these basic networks extensively on many\nbenchmark visual datasets for different tasks, such as LFW for face\nverification, MultiPIE, Extended Yale B, AR, FERET datasets for face\nrecognition, as well as MNIST for hand-written digits recognition.\nSurprisingly, for all tasks, such a seemingly naive PCANet model is on par with\nthe state of the art features, either prefixed, highly hand-crafted or\ncarefully learned (by DNNs). Even more surprisingly, it sets new records for\nmany classification tasks in Extended Yale B, AR, FERET datasets, and MNIST\nvariations. Additional experiments on other public datasets also demonstrate\nthe potential of the PCANet serving as a simple but highly competitive baseline\nfor texture classification and object recognition.\n'

S'  Learning to rank is a supervised learning problem where the output space is\nthe space of rankings but the supervision space is the space of relevance\nscores. We make theoretical contributions to the learning to rank problem both\nin the online and batch settings. First, we propose a perceptron-like algorithm\nfor learning a ranking function in an online setting. Our algorithm is an\nextension of the classic perceptron algorithm for the classification problem.\nSecond, in the setting of batch learning, we introduce a sufficient condition\nfor convex ranking surrogates to ensure a generalization bound that is\nindependent of number of objects per query. Our bound holds when linear ranking\nfunctions are used: a common practice in many learning to rank algorithms. En\nroute to developing the online algorithm and generalization bound, we propose a\nnovel family of listwise large margin ranking surrogates. Our novel surrogate\nfamily is obtained by modifying a well-known pairwise large margin ranking\nsurrogate and is distinct from the listwise large margin surrogates developed\nusing the structured prediction framework. Using the proposed family, we\nprovide a guaranteed upper bound on the cumulative NDCG (or MAP) induced loss\nunder the perceptron-like algorithm. We also show that the novel surrogates\nsatisfy the generalization bound condition.\n'

S'  Understanding the spin-texture behavior of boundary modes in ultrathin\ntopological insulator films is critically essential for the design and\nfabrication of functional nano-devices. Here by using spin-resolved\nphotoemission spectroscopy with p-polarized light in topological insulator\nBi2Se3 thin films, we report tunneling-dependent evolution of spin\nconfiguration in topological insulator thin films across the metal-to-insulator\ntransition. We observe strongly binding energy- and wavevector-dependent spin\npolarization for the topological surface electrons in the ultra-thin\ngapped-Dirac-cone limit. The polarization decreases significantly with enhanced\ntunneling realized systematically in thin insulating films, whereas magnitude\nof the polarization saturates to the bulk limit faster at larger wavevectors in\nthicker metallic films. We present a theoretical model which captures this\ndelicate relationship between quantum tunneling and Fermi surface spin\npolarization. Our high-resolution spin-based spectroscopic results suggest that\nthe polarization current can be tuned to zero in thin insulating films forming\nthe basis for a future spin-switch nano-device.\n'

S"  Calculating portions of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of matrices or matrix\npencils has many applications. An approach to this calculation for Hermitian\nproblems based on a density matrix has been proposed in 2009 and a software\npackage called FEAST has been developed. The density-matrix approach allows\nFEAST's implementation to exploit a key strength of modern computer\narchitectures, namely, multiple levels of parallelism. Consequently, the\nsoftware package has been well received and subsequently commercialized. A\ndetailed theoretical analysis of Hermitian FEAST has also been established very\nrecently. This paper generalizes the FEAST algorithm and theory, for the first\ntime, to tackle non-Hermitian problems. Fundamentally, the new algorithm is\nbasic subspace iteration or Bauer bi-iteration, except applied with a novel\naccelerator based on Cauchy integrals. The resulting algorithm retains the\nmulti-level parallelism of Hermitian FEAST, making it a valuable new tool for\nlarge-scale computational science and engineering problems on leading-edge\ncomputing platforms.\n"

Here I address this question by\nintroducing a simple model of flow through a network with randomly-placed\n``congestible" and ``incongestible" links.

S'  In a previous study, we have discovered that nonlinear processes can be\nenhanced several orders of magnitude due to the path interference effects which\nare introduced by Fano resonances. Emergence of this phenomenon has been\ndemonstrated also in 3-dimensional solutions of Maxwell equations. However,\nenhancement has been found to be limited by the decay rate of the plasmonic\noscillations. In the present work, we demonstrate that such a limitation can be\nlifted o? when the path interference from two quantum emitters to a plasmonic\nresonator (second harmonic converter) is considered. Enhancement factors much\nlarger than 7 orders of magnitude are possible using such an interference\nscheme. Therefore, a single hybridized system of 3 particles (manufactured\ncarefully) can account for almost all of the second harmonic generated\nradiation emitted from a sample of plasmonic particle clusters decorated with\nquantum emitters (e.g. a spaser).\n'

Among these,\nsemiconductor QDs offer distinctive capabilities including on-demand operation,\ncoherent control, frequency tuning and compatibility with semiconductor\nnanotechnology. Moreover, the coherence of QD photons can be significantly\nenhanced in resonance fluorescence(RF) approaching at its best the coherence of\nthe excitation laser. However, the implementation of QD RF in scalable on-chip\ngeometries remains challenging due to the need to suppress stray laser photons.\nHere we report on-chip QD RF coupled into a single-mode waveguide with\nnegligible resonant laser background and show that the coherence is enhanced\ncompared to off-resonant excitation. The results pave the way to a novel class\nof integrated quantum-optical devices for on-chip QIP with embedded\nresonantly-driven quantum emitters.\n'

Super-efficiency DEA is employed to\nevaluate and rank features via their conditional dependence scores on all class\nlabels, and the feature with maximum super-efficiency score is then added in\nthe conditioning set for conditional dependence estimation in the next\niteration, in such a way as to iteratively select features and get the final\nselected features. Eventually, experiments are conducted to evaluate the\neffectiveness of proposed method comparing with four state-of-the-art methods\nfrom the viewpoint of classification accuracy. Empirical results verify the\nfeasibility and the superiority of proposed feature selection method.\n'

S'  As high-throughput sequencers become standard equipment outside of sequencing\ncenters, there is an increasing need for efficient methods for pre-processing\nand primary analysis. While a vast literature proposes methods for HTS data\nanalysis, we argue that significant improvements can still be gained by\nexploiting expensive pre-processing steps which can be amortized with savings\nfrom later stages. We propose a method to accelerate and improve read mapping\nbased on an initial clustering of possibly billions of high-throughput\nsequencing reads, yielding clusters of high stringency and a high degree of\noverlap. This clustering improves on the state-of-the-art in running time for\nsmall datasets and, for the first time, makes clustering high-coverage human\nlibraries feasible. Given the efficiently computed clusters, only one\nrepresentative read from each cluster needs to be mapped using a traditional\nreadmapper such as BWA, instead of individually mapping all reads. On human\nreads, all processing steps, including clustering and mapping, only require\n11%-59% of the time for individually mapping all reads, achieving speed-ups for\nall readmappers, while minimally affecting mapping quality. This accelerates a\nhighly sensitive readmapper such as Stampy to be competitive with a fast\nreadmapper such as BWA on unclustered reads.\n'

S'  Causal calculus is a tool to express causal effects in the terms of\nobservational probability distributions. The application of causal calculus in\nthe non-parametric form requires only the knowledge of the causal structure.\nHowever, some kind of explicit modeling is needed when numeric estimates of the\ncausal effect are to be calculated. In this paper, the estimation of\ncomplicated nonlinear causal relationships from observational data is studied.\nIt is demonstrated that the estimation of causal effects does not necessarily\nrequire the causal model to be specified parametrically but it suffices to\nmodel directly the observational probability distributions. The conditions when\nthis approach produces valid estimates are discussed. Generalized additive\nmodels, random forests and neural networks are applied to the estimation of\ncausal effects in examples featuring the backdoor and the frontdoor adjustment.\n'

S'  DNA methylation plays a pivotal role in the genetic evolution of both\nembryonic and adult cells. For adult somatic cells, location and dynamics of\nmethylation has been very precisely pinned down with the 5-cytosine markers on\ncytosinephosphate- guanine (CpG) units. Unusual methylation on CpG islands are\nidentified as one of the prime causes for silencing the tumor suppressant\ngenes. Early detection of such methylation can diagnose the potentially harmful\noncogenic evolution of cells, and provide a promising guideline for cancer\nprevention. With this motivation, we propose a cytosine methylation detection\ntechnique.Our hypothesis is that electronic signatures of DNA acquired as a\nmolecule translocates through a nanopore, would be significantly different for\nmethylated and non-methylated bases. This difference in electronic fingerprints\nwould allow for reliable real-time differentiations of methylated DNA. We\ncalculate transport currents through a punctured graphene membrane while the\ncytosine and methylated cytosine translocate through the nanopore. We also\ncalculate the transport properties for uracil and cyanocytosine for comparison.\nOur calculations of transmission, current, and tunneling conductance show\ndistinct signatures in their spectrum for each molecular type. Thus, in this\nwork, we provide a theoretical analysis that points to a viability of our\nhypothesis.\n'

S'  The slowdown of optical pulses due to quantum-coherence effects is\ninvestigated theoretically for an "active material" consisting of InGaAs-based\ndouble quantum-dot molecules. These are designed to exhibit a long lived\ncoherence between two electronic levels, which is an essential part of a\nquantum coherence scheme that makes use of electromagnetically-induced\ntransparency effects to achieve group velocity slowdown. We apply a\nmany-particle approach based on realistic semiconductor parameters that allows\nus to calculate the quantum-dot material dynamics including microscopic carrier\nscattering and polarisation dephasing dynamics. The group-velocity reduction is\ncharacterized in the frequency domain by a quasi-equilibrium slow-down factor\nand in the time domain by the probe-pulse slowdown obtained from a calculation\nof the spatio-temporal material dynamics coupled to the propagating optical\nfield. The group-velocity slowdown in the quantum-dot molecule is shown to be\nsubstantially higher than what is achievable from similar transitions in\ntypical InGaAs-based single quantum dots. The dependences of slowdown and shape\nof the propagating probe pulses on lattice temperature and drive intensities\nare investigated.\n'

S'  We propose an algebraic combinatorial method for solving large sparse linear\nsystems of equations locally - that is, a method which can compute single\nevaluations of the signal without computing the whole signal. The method scales\nonly in the sparsity of the system and not in its size, and allows to provide\nerror estimates for any solution method. At the heart of our approach is the\nso-called regression matroid, a combinatorial object associated to sparsity\npatterns, which allows to replace inversion of the large matrix with the\ninversion of a kernel matrix that is constant size. We show that our method\nprovides the best linear unbiased estimator (BLUE) for this setting and the\nminimum variance unbiased estimator (MVUE) under Gaussian noise assumptions,\nand furthermore we show that the size of the kernel matrix which is to be\ninverted can be traded off with accuracy.\n'

S"  Fisher's exact test is often a preferred method to estimate the significance\nof statistical dependence. However, in large data sets the test is usually too\nworksome to be applied, especially in an exhaustive search (data mining). The\ntraditional solution is to approximate the significance with the\n$\\chi^2$-measure, but the accuracy is often unacceptable. As a solution, we\nintroduce a family of upper bounds, which are fast to calculate and approximate\nFisher's $p$-value accurately. In addition, the new approximations are not\nsensitive to the data size, distribution, or smallest expected counts like the\n$\\chi^2$-based approximation. According to both theoretical and experimental\nanalysis, the new approximations produce accurate results for all sufficiently\nstrong dependencies. The basic form of the approximation can fail with weak\ndependencies, but the general form of the upper bounds can be adjusted to be\narbitrarily accurate.\n"

S'  A skyrmion is a topological texture in the continuum field theory. Recent\nexperimental observation of skyrmions in chiral magnet evokes a flourish of its\nextensive study. Skyrmion is expected to be a key component of the next\ngeneration spintronics device called skyrmionics. On the other hand, there is a\nwell established memory device encoded by a sequence of domain walls. A\nskyrmion carries a topological number, whereas a domain wall does not.\nNevertheless, we show a conversion is possible between a skyrmion and a\ndomain-wall pair by connecting wide and narrow nanowires, enabling the\ninformation transmission between skyrmion device and domain-wall device. Our\nresults will be the basis of a hybrid device made of skyrmions and domain\nwalls, where the encoded information in domain walls is converted into\nskyrmions, and then read out by converting the skyrmions back to domain walls\nafter a functional control of the skyrmions.\n'

Second, by using this extension, we demonstrate optimal\nconvergence rates with respect to a modified approximation class defined\nthrough the total error, as is customary since the seminal work of Cascon,\nKreuzer, Nochetto and Siebert. Third, building on the tools developed in the\npapers of Binev, Dahmen, DeVore, and Petrushev, and of Gaspoz and Morin, we\nprove that the modified approximation class coincides with the standard\napproximation class (the latter defined through the energy error), modulo the\nassumption that the data is regular enough in an appropriate scale of Besov\nspaces.\n'

We\ncharacterize the critical strain, statistics of breaking versus making a\ncontact, and ratio of shear modulus before and after such events, and explain\ntheir finite size scaling relations. For large systems at finite pressure, the\ncritical strain vanishes but the ratio of shear modulus before and after a\ncontact change approaches one: linear response remains relevant in large\nsystems. For finite systems close to jamming the critical strain also vanishes,\nbut here linear response already breaks down after a single contact change.\n'

S'  The penalization method is used to take account of obstacles, such as the\nlimiter, in a tokamak. Because of the magnetic confinement of the plasma in a\ntokamak, the transport occurs essentially in the direction parallel to the\nmagnetic field lines. We study a 1D nonlinear hyperbolic system as a simplified\nmodel of the plasma transport in the area close to the wall. A penalization\nwhich cuts the flux term of the momentum is studied. We show numerically that\nthis penalization creates a Dirac measure at the plasma-limiter interface which\nprevents us from defining the transport term in the usual distribution sense.\nHence, a new penalty method is proposed for this hyperbolic system. For this\npenalty method, an asymptotic expansion and numerical tests give an optimal\nrate of convergence without spurious boundary layer. Another two-fields\npenalization has also been implemented and the numerical convergence analysis\nwhen the penalization parameter tends to $0$ reveals the presence of a boundary\nlayer.\n'

After the milling process, the\ncoercivity of the nanoparticles reached 3.75 kOe - a value almost five times\nhigher than that obtained for the non-milled sample. We performed a thermal\ntreatment on the milled sample at 300, 400, and 600 oC for 30 and 180 mins, and\nstudied the changes in the magnetic parameters due to the thermal treatment\nusing the hysteresis curves, Williamson-Hall analysis, and transmission\nelectron microscopy. The thermal treatment at 600 oC causes a decrease in the\nmicrostructural strain and density of structural defects resulting in a\nsignificant decrease in coercivity. Furthermore, this thermal treatment\nincreases the size of the nanoparticles and, as a consequence, there is a\nsubstantial increase in the saturation magnetization. The coercivity and the\nsaturation magnetization are less affected by the thermal treatment at 300 and\n400 oC.\n'

S'  The clustering ensemble technique aims to combine multiple clusterings into a\nprobably better and more robust clustering and has been receiving an increasing\nattention in recent years. There are mainly two aspects of limitations in the\nexisting clustering ensemble approaches. Firstly, many approaches lack the\nability to weight the base clusterings without access to the original data and\ncan be affected significantly by the low-quality, or even ill clusterings.\nSecondly, they generally focus on the instance level or cluster level in the\nensemble system and fail to integrate multi-granularity cues into a unified\nmodel. To address these two limitations, this paper proposes to solve the\nclustering ensemble problem via crowd agreement estimation and\nmulti-granularity link analysis. We present the normalized crowd agreement\nindex (NCAI) to evaluate the quality of base clusterings in an unsupervised\nmanner and thus weight the base clusterings in accordance with their clustering\nvalidity. To explore the relationship between clusters, the source aware\nconnected triple (SACT) similarity is introduced with regard to their common\nneighbors and the source reliability. Based on NCAI and multi-granularity\ninformation collected among base clusterings, clusters, and data instances, we\nfurther propose two novel consensus functions, termed weighted evidence\naccumulation clustering (WEAC) and graph partitioning with multi-granularity\nlink analysis (GP-MGLA) respectively. The experiments are conducted on eight\nreal-world datasets. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and\nrobustness of the proposed methods.\n'

S'  We show that the Survey Propagation guided decimation algorithm fails to find\nsatisfying assignments on random instances of the "Not-All-Equal-K-SAT"\nproblem, well below the satisfiability threshold. Our analysis applies to a\nbroad class of algorithms that may be described as "sequential local\nalgorithms" --such algorithms iteratively set variables based on some local\ninformation and/or local randomness, and then recurse on the reduced instance.\nSurvey Propagation guided as well as Belief Propagation guided decimation\nalgorithms, studied widely in the past, fall under this category of algorithms.\nOur main technical result shows that under fairly mild conditions, sequential\nlocal algorithms find satisfying assignments only when the solution space is\nnicely connected, despite the earlier predictions by statistical physicists.\nCombined with the knowledge that the solution space tends to cluster well\nbefore the satisfiability threshold, our main result follows immediately. This\napproach of showing that local algorithms work only when the solution space is\nconnected has been applied before in the literature: the novelty of our work is\nour ability to extend the approach also to sequential local algorithms.\n'

S'  Selecting between different dependence structures of a hidden Markov random\nfield can be very challenging, due to the intractable normalizing constants in\nthe likelihoods and the sum over all possible latent random fields. Approximate\nBayesian Computation (ABC) algorithms provide a model choice method in the\nBayesian paradigm. The scheme compares the observed data and many numerical\nsimulations through summary statistics. When the Gibbs random field is directly\nobserved, Grelaud et al. (2009) exhibit sufficient summary statistics that\nimmediately guarantee the consistency of the ABC algorithm. But, when the\nrandom field is hidden, those statistics are not sufficient anymore. We provide\nnew summary statistics based on the geometry of the image, more precisely a\nclustering analysis of pixels. To assess their efficiency, we also derive a\nconditional misclassification rate evaluating the power of ABC algorithms which\nmay be of independent interest.\n'

S'  In the first part of this work a summary is provided of some recent\nexperiments and theoretical results which are relevant in the research of\nsystems of polymer rings in nontrivial topological conformations. Next, some\nadvances in modeling the behavior of single polymer knots are presented. The\nnumerical simulations are performed with the help of the Wang-Landau Monte\nCarlo algorithm. To sample the polymer conformation a set of random\ntransformations called pivot moves is used. The crucial problem of preserving\nthe topology of the knots after each move is tackled with the help of two new\ntechniques which are briefly explained. As an application, the results of an\ninvestigation of the effects of topology on the thermal properties of polymer\nknots is reported. In the end, original results are discussed concerning the\nuse of parallelized codes to study polymers knots composed by a large number of\nsegments within the Wang-Landau approach.\n'

S'  A pentagonal order formed by 360 proteins in the bovine papilloma viral\ncapsid and structures of some smaller viral capsids are considered from a\nunified point of view based on the Landau crystallization theory. To simulate\nthe capsid structures we map the planar pentagonal Penrose quasilattice (PPQ)\nconstructed in the frames of the Landau theory onto a sphere through the\ndodecahedron nets of different sizes. Six different simplest nets containing\nfrom 60 to 360 positions occupied by proteins are proposed. Buckling of the\ninitially planar capsid faces and a smooth conjugation of the protein orders at\nthe adjacent faces are taken into account by means of two conditions imposed on\nthe minimization of the capsid free energy. This conditional minimization\nresults in two-component phason strain field, which describes the\nself-consistent reconstruction of quasicrystalline orders located at twelve\nfaces of spherical dodecahedron. All six chiral structures obtained in this way\nare very similar to those of well-known spherical viral capsids. The theory\nproposed explains some general peculiarities of protein organization in capsids\nof small and medium-sized viruses.\n'

S'  Connected component analysis (CCA) has been heavily used to label binary\nimages and classify segments. However, it has not been well-exploited to\nsegment multi-valued natural images. This work proposes a novel multi-value\nsegmentation algorithm that utilizes CCA to segment color images. A user\ndefined distance measure is incorporated in the proposed modified CCA to\nidentify and segment similar image regions. The raw output of the algorithm\nconsists of distinctly labelled segmented regions. The proposed algorithm has a\nunique design architecture that provides several benefits: 1) it can be used to\nsegment any multi-channel multi-valued image; 2) the distance\nmeasure/segmentation criteria can be application-specific and 3) an absolute\nlinear-time implementation allows easy extension for real-time video\nsegmentation. Experimental demonstrations of the aforesaid benefits are\npresented along with the comparison results on multiple datasets with current\nbenchmark algorithms. A number of possible application areas are also\nidentified and results on real-time video segmentation has been presented to\nshow the promise of the proposed method.\n'

S"  In this paper, we propose a method for tracking structures (e.g., ventricles\nand myocardium) in cardiac images (e.g., magnetic resonance) by propagating\nforward in time a previous estimate of the structures via a new deformation\nestimation scheme that is motivated by physical constraints of fluid motion.\nThe method employs within structure motion estimation (so that differing\nmotions among different structures are not mixed) while simultaneously\nsatisfying the physical constraint in fluid motion that at the interface\nbetween a fluid and a medium, the normal component of the fluid's motion must\nmatch the normal component of the motion of the medium. We show how to estimate\nthe motion according to the previous considerations in a variational framework,\nand in particular, show that these conditions lead to PDEs with boundary\nconditions at the interface that resemble Robin boundary conditions and induce\ncoupling between structures. We illustrate the use of this motion estimation\nscheme in propagating a segmentation across frames and show that it leads to\nmore accurate segmentation than traditional motion estimation that does not\nmake use of physical constraints. Further, the method is naturally suited to\ninteractive segmentation methods, which are prominently used in practice in\ncommercial applications for cardiac analysis, where typically a segmentation\nfrom the previous frame is used to predict a segmentation in the next frame. We\nshow that our propagation scheme reduces the amount of user interaction by\npredicting more accurate segmentations than commonly used and recent\ninteractive commercial techniques.\n"

We formulate the reconstruction problem as a regularized\nnonlinear optimization problem to simultaneously solve for object brightness\nand attenuation, where the attenuation can become infinite. We demonstrate\nvarious simulated examples for imaging opaque objects, including sparse point\nsources, a conventional multiview reconstruction technique, and a\nsuper-resolving technique which exploits occlusion to resolve an image.\n'

This problem is routinely\ncast as a supervised task with label noise in the negative set. We use an\nensemble of SVM models trained on bootstrap subsamples of the training data for\nincreased robustness against label noise. The approach can be considered in a\nbagging framework which provides an intuitive explanation for its mechanics in\na semi-supervised setting. We compared our method to state-of-the-art\napproaches in a simulation based on the MNIST digit recognition data set. The\nincluded benchmark comprises three settings with increasing label noise: (i)\nfully supervised, (ii) PU learning and (iii) PU learning with false positives.\nOur approach shows a marginal improvement over existing methods in the second\nsetting and a significant improvement in the third.\n'

The considered nonlinear problems are associated with the minimization\nof a parameterized differentiable convex functional. We first introduce a\nbilinear parameterization of fixed-rank tensors and employ an alternating\nminimization scheme for computing the low-rank approximation. In keeping with\nthe idea of non-intrusiveness, at each step of the algorithm the minimizations\nare carried out with a quasi-Newton method to avoid the computation of the\nHessian. The algorithm is made non-intrusive through the use of numerical\nintegration. It only requires the evaluation of residuals at specific parameter\nvalues. The algorithm is then applied to two numerical examples.\n'

S'  In this paper, we focus on distance metric learning (DML) for high\ndimensional data and its application to fine-grained visual categorization. The\nchallenges of high dimensional DML arise in three aspects. First, the high\ndimensionality leads to a large-scale optimization problem to be solved that is\ncomputationally expensive. Second, the high dimensionality requires a large\nstorage space (i.e. $\\mathcal{O}(d^2)$ where $d$ is the dimensionality) for\nsaving the learned metric. Third, the high dimensionality requires a large\nnumber of constraints for training that adds more complexity to the already\ndifficult optimization problem. We develop an integrated framework for high\ndimensional DML that explicitly addresses the three challenges by exploiting\nthe techniques of {\\it dual random projection}, {\\it randomized low rank matrix\napproximation}, and {\\it adaptive sampling}. We demonstrate the effectiveness\nof the proposed algorithm for high dimensional DML by fine-grained visual\ncategorization (FGVC), a challenging prediction problem that needs to capture\nthe subtle difference among image classes. Our empirical study shows that the\nproposed algorithm is both effective and efficient for FGVC compared to the\nstate-of-the-art approaches.\n'

In this paper, we give new insights into this relationship in the\ncontext of multiple linear regression. We show, in particular, that the\nincorporation of a simple correlation measure into the tuning parameter leads\nto a nearly optimal prediction performance of the Lasso even for highly\ncorrelated covariates. However, we also reveal that for moderately correlated\ncovariates, the prediction performance of the Lasso can be mediocre\nirrespective of the choice of the tuning parameter. For the illustration of our\napproach with an important application, we deduce nearly optimal rates for the\nleast-squares estimator with total variation penalty.\n'

S'  We present a loosely-coupled partitioned scheme for a benchmark problem in\nfluid-composite structure interaction. The benchmark problem proposed here\nconsists of an incompressible, viscous fluid interacting with a composite\nstructure that consists of two layers: a thin elastic layer which is in contact\nwith the fluid, and a thick elastic layer which sits on top of the thin layer.\nThe motivation comes from fluid-structure interaction (FSI) in hemodyam- ics.\nThe equations of linear elasticity are used to model the thick structural\nlayer, while the Koiter member/shell equations are used to model the thin\nstructural layer which serves as fluid-structure interface with mass. An effi-\ncient, modular, operator-splitting scheme is proposed to simulate solutions to\nthe coupled, nonlinear FSI problem. The operator splitting scheme sepa- rates\nthe elastodynamics structure problem, from a fluid problem in which the thin\nstructure inertia is included as a Robin-type boundary condition to achieve\nunconditional stability, without requiring any sub-iterations within\ntime-steps. An energy estimate associated with unconditional stability is\nderived for the fully nonlinear FSI problem defined on moving domains. Two\ninstructive numerical examples are presented to test the performance of the\nscheme, where it is shown numerically, that the scheme is at least first-order\naccurate in time. The second example reveals a new phenomenon in FSI problems:\nthe presence of a thin fluid-structure interface with mass regularizes\nsolutions to the full FSI problem.\n'

Although the model in\nconsideration is natural and useful in many practical applications, the\nliterature on this model is very limited because of challenges in dealing with\ndependent data for nonparametric additive models. We show that the proposed\nestimators are consistent and asymptotically normal even if the covariance\nstructure is misspecified. An explicit consistent estimate of the asymptotic\nvariance is also provided. Moreover, we derive the semiparametric efficiency\nscore and information bound under general moment conditions. By showing that\nour estimators achieve the semiparametric information bound, we effectively\nestablish their efficiency in a stronger sense than what is typically\nconsidered for GEE. The derivation of our asymptotic results relies heavily on\nthe empirical processes tools that we develop for the longitudinal/clustered\ndata. Numerical results are used to illustrate the finite sample performance of\nthe proposed estimators.\n'

However, many porous systems such as\nglacial drainage networks, erosional river bed networks, vascular networks,\nsocial insect swarms and animal architectures such as termite mounds are\ncontinuously remodeled by the flow and thence modify the flow, i.e. they are\nactive. Here we consider a minimal model for an active porous medium where flow\nand resistance are coupled to each other. Using numerical simulations, we show\nthat this results in both channelization and wall-building transitions\ndepending on the form of the feedback. A continuum model allows us to\nunderstand the qualitative features of the resulting phase diagram, and\nsuggests ways to realize complex architectures using simple rules in engineered\nsystems.\n'

S'  Above the upper critical dimension, the breakdown of hyperscaling is\nassociated with dangerous irrelevant variables in the renormalization group\nformalism at least for systems with periodic boundary conditions. While these\nhave been extensively studied, there have been only a few analyses of\nfinite-size scaling with free boundary conditions. The conventional expectation\nthere is that, in contrast to periodic geometries, finite-size scaling is\nGaussian, governed by a correlation length commensurate with the lattice\nextent. Here, detailed numerical studies of the five-dimensional Ising model\nindicate that this expectation is unsupported, both at the infinite-volume\ncritical point and at the pseudocritical point where the finite-size\nsusceptibility peaks. Instead the evidence indicates that finite-size scaling\nat the pseudocritical point is similar to that in the periodic case. An\nanalytic explanation is offered which allows hyperscaling to be extended beyond\nthe upper critical dimension.\n'

This class is directly\nrelevant to Nekrasov partition functions of $\\mathcal{N}=2$ SUSY gauge theories\non the 4d $\\Omega$-background, for which $\\epsilon$ is identified with one of\nthe equivariant deformation parameter. In the Nekrasov-Shatashvili limit\n$\\epsilon\\to0$, we show that the free energy is given by an on-shell effective\naction. The equations of motion take the form of a TBA equation. The free\nenergy is identified with the Yang-Yang functional of the corresponding system\nof Bethe roots. We further study the associated canonical model that takes the\nform of a generalized matrix model. Confinement of the eigenvalues by the\nshort-range potential is observed. In the limit where this confining potential\nbecomes weak, the collective field theory formulation is recovered. Finally, we\ndiscuss the connection with the alternative expression of instanton partition\nfunctions as sums over Young tableaux.\n'

S"  An efficient approach to handle localized states by using spectral methods\n(SM) in one and three dimensions is presented. The method consists of\ntransformation of the infinite domain to the bounded domain in $(0, \\pi)$ and\nusing the Fourier sine series as a set of basis functions for the SM. It is\nshown that with an appropriate choice of transformation functions, this method\nmanages to preserve the good properties of original SMs; more precisely, superb\ncomputational efficiency when high level of accuracy is necessary. This is made\npossible by analytically exploiting the properties of the transformation\nfunction and the Fourier sine series. An especially important property of this\napproach is the possibility of calculating the Hartree energy very efficiently.\nThis is done by exploiting the positive properties of the sine series as a\nbasis set and conducting an extinctive part of the calculations analytically.\nWe illustrate the efficiency of this method and implement it to solve the\nPoisson's and Helmholtz equations in both one and three dimensions. The\nefficiency of the method is verified through a comparison to recently published\nresults for both one and three dimensional problems.\n"

S'  The need to relate measurements made by a camera to a different known\ncoordinate system arises in many engineering applications. Historically, it\nappeared for the first time in the connection with cameras mounted on robotic\nsystems. This problem is commonly known as hand-eye calibration. In this paper,\nwe present several formulations of hand-eye calibration that lead to\nmultivariate polynomial optimization problems. We show that the method of\nconvex linear matrix inequality (LMI) relaxations can be used to effectively\nsolve these problems and to obtain globally optimal solutions. Further, we show\nthat the same approach can be used for the simultaneous hand-eye and\nrobot-world calibration. Finally, we validate the proposed solutions using both\nsynthetic and real datasets.\n'

S'  In this paper, we propose a theory which unifies kernel learning and symbolic\nalgebraic methods. We show that both worlds are inherently dual to each other,\nand we use this duality to combine the structure-awareness of algebraic methods\nwith the efficiency and generality of kernels. The main idea lies in relating\npolynomial rings to feature space, and ideals to manifolds, then exploiting\nthis generative-discriminative duality on kernel matrices. We illustrate this\nby proposing two algorithms, IPCA and AVICA, for simultaneous manifold and\nfeature learning, and test their accuracy on synthetic and real world data.\n'

The method uses the probabilistic form of the exact\nsolution of the linear mesh generator to provide the sub-domain interface\nvalues that serve as boundary conditions for the domain decomposition. The\nmeshes over the single sub-domains can then be obtained independently of each\nother in an entirely parallel fashion. We demonstrate numerically the\ncapability of the method to yield smooth, time-evolving meshes.\n'

The paper focuses on a surface instability occuring during the\ndrying process, in a gel phase, before crack propagation. From macroscopic and\nmicroscopic observations, we characterize the occurence of the instability, and\nthe morphology of the film surface. Results suggest that the instability\nresults from creases-like patterns. Futhermore, we show that the addition of\nadsorbing polymers on silica particles can be used to suppress the instability\nunder particular conditions of molecular weight and concentration. We relate\nthis suppression to the increase of the gel elastic modulus.\n'

S'  The object of this work is to design an adequate regularization for the\nproblem of recovering missing Fourier coefficients, particularly in some non\nstandard situations were low frequency coefficients are lost. In the framework\nof non-local regularization, we propose a technique to build an original\npatchwise similarity measure that is adapted to the missing spectrum. Then, a\nsimple Non-Local quadratic energy is minimized. By construction, the similarity\ncriterion is invariant under the corruption process so that the distance\nbetween two patches of the corrupted image is almost exactly equal to the one\ncomputed on the clean image. We illustrate our method with experiments which\nshow its efficiency, both in terms of speed and quality of the results, with\nrespect to other common approaches. We show that the method is practical on\nsynthetic examples which are built upon models of inverse scattering problems,\nsynthetic aperture mirrors for spatial imaging or also medical imaging.\n'

S'  For testing independence it is very popular to use either the\n$\\chi^{2}$-statistic or $G^{2}$-statistics (mutual information). Asymptotically\nboth are $\\chi^{2}$-distributed so an obvious question is which of the two\nstatistics that has a distribution that is closest to the\n$\\chi^{2}$-distribution. Surprisingly the distribution of mutual information is\nmuch better approximated by a $\\chi^{2}$-distribution than the\n$\\chi^{2}$-statistic. For technical reasons we shall focus on the simplest case\nwith one degree of freedom. We introduce the signed log-likelihood and\ndemonstrate that its distribution function can be related to the distribution\nfunction of a standard Gaussian by inequalities. For the hypergeometric\ndistribution we formulate a general conjecture about how close the signed\nlog-likelihood is to a standard Gaussian, and this conjecture gives much more\naccurate estimates of the tail probabilities of this type of distribution than\npreviously published results. The conjecture has been proved numerically in all\ncases relevant for testing independence and further evidence of its validity is\ngiven.\n'

S'  Joint matching over a collection of objects aims at aggregating information\nfrom a large collection of similar instances (e.g. images, graphs, shapes) to\nimprove maps between pairs of them. Given multiple matches computed between a\nfew object pairs in isolation, the goal is to recover an entire collection of\nmaps that are (1) globally consistent, and (2) close to the provided maps ---\nand under certain conditions provably the ground-truth maps. Despite recent\nadvances on this problem, the best-known recovery guarantees are limited to a\nsmall constant barrier --- none of the existing methods find theoretical\nsupport when more than $50\\%$ of input correspondences are corrupted. Moreover,\nprior approaches focus mostly on fully similar objects, while it is practically\nmore demanding to match instances that are only partially similar to each\nother.\n  In this paper, we develop an algorithm to jointly match multiple objects that\nexhibit only partial similarities, given a few pairwise matches that are\ndensely corrupted. Specifically, we propose to recover the ground-truth maps\nvia a parameter-free convex program called MatchLift, following a spectral\nmethod that pre-estimates the total number of distinct elements to be matched.\nEncouragingly, MatchLift exhibits near-optimal error-correction ability, i.e.\nin the asymptotic regime it is guaranteed to work even when a dominant fraction\n$1-\\Theta\\left(\\frac{\\log^{2}n}{\\sqrt{n}}\\right)$ of the input maps behave like\nrandom outliers. Furthermore, MatchLift succeeds with minimal input complexity,\nnamely, perfect matching can be achieved as soon as the provided maps form a\nconnected map graph. We evaluate the proposed algorithm on various benchmark\ndata sets including synthetic examples and real-world examples, all of which\nconfirm the practical applicability of MatchLift.\n'

S'  The feature of interaction electrons with neutral matter attracts large\nattention of physicists many directions. The exchange interaction in particular\nleads to creating of bubbles - spherical cavities with electron in center. Good\nobject for such study is system of surface electrons formed over surface of\ndielectric with small permittivity. Investigation of the autolocalization of SE\non liquid helium surface attracts high attention, because system is the\nextremely clear and easily governed. Bubbles have small mobility relatively of\nfree electrons and that is used for monitoring of the transition process. As\nhas recently been investigated the quasi-one-dimensional electrons over liquid\nhelium form the autolocalized states at smaller gas density in compared to 3D\nand 2D situations. The process significantly depends from a substrate and its\nquality. The autolocalization of one-dimensional electrons in a gas phase over\nliquid helium covering a substrate at both situations with or without the\npotential variations is theme of present study. The features of conductivity in\npresence of potential variations the authors explain by both the dynamic\nprocesses of changing the subsystem energy at appear or disappear electron\nautolocalization and by thermo-insulation of electron subsystem from\nthermostat.\n'

Given a noisy measurement of a\nproduct of two matrices, the problem is to estimate back the original matrices.\nIt arises in many applications such as dictionary learning, blind matrix\ncalibration, sparse principal component analysis, blind source separation, low\nrank matrix completion, robust principal component analysis or factor analysis.\nWe use the tools of statistical mechanics - the cavity and replica methods - to\nanalyze the achievability and tractability of the inference problems in the\nsetting of Bayes-optimal inference, which amounts to assuming that the two\nmatrices have random independent elements generated from some known\ndistribution, and this information is available to the inference algorithm. In\nthis setting, we compute the minimal mean-squared-error achievable in principle\nin any computational time, and the error that can be achieved by an efficient\napproximate message passing algorithm. The computation is based on the\nasymptotic state-evolution analysis of the algorithm. The performance that our\nanalysis predicts, both in terms of the achieved mean-squared-error, and in\nterms of sample complexity, is extremely promising and motivating for a further\ndevelopment of the algorithm.\n'

Second, the thesis introduces two\ndimensionality reduction steps, Random Projections, a known feature extraction\ntechnique based on the Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma, and a new method termed\nMass Transportation Distance (MTD) Feature Selection for discrete domains.\nThen, this thesis compares the performance of Random Projections with the k-NN\nclassifier against MTD Feature Selection and Random Forest, for predicting\nartery disease based on accuracy, the F-Measure, and area under the Receiver\nOperating Characteristic (ROC) curve.\n  The comparative results demonstrate that MTD Feature Selection with Random\nForest is vastly superior to Random Projections and k-NN. The Random Forest\nclassifier is able to obtain an accuracy of 0.6660 and an area under the ROC\ncurve of 0.8562 on the OHGS genetic dataset, when 3335 SNPs are selected by MTD\nFeature Selection for classification. This area is considerably better than the\nprevious high score of 0.608 obtained by Davies et al. in 2010 on the same\ndataset.\n'

S'  The development of energy and infrastructure efficient water purification\nsystems are among the most critical engineering challenges facing our society.\nWater purification is often a multi-step process involving filtration,\ndesalination, and disinfection of a feedstream. Shock electrodialysis (shock\nED) is a newly developed technique for water desalination, leveraging the\nformation of ion concentration polarization (ICP) zones and deionization shock\nwaves in microscale pores near to an ion selective element. While shock ED has\nbeen demonstrated as an effective water desalination tool, we here present\nevidence of other simultaneous functionalities. We show that, unlike\nelectrodialysis, shock ED can thoroughly filter micron-scale particles and\naggregates of nanoparticles present in the feedwater. We also demonstrate that\nshock ED can enable disinfection of feedwaters, as approximately $99\\%$ of\nviable bacteria (here \\textit{E. coli}) in the inflow were killed or removed by\nour prototype. Shock ED also separates positive from negative particles,\ncontrary to claims that ICP acts as a virtual barrier for all charged\nparticles. By combining these functionalities (filtration, separation and\ndisinfection) with deionization, shock ED has the potential to enable more\ncompact and efficient water purification systems.\n'

Our formulation is based on an\nadaptive particle filtering scheme that uses a multi-agent motion model based\non velocity-obstacles, and takes into account local interactions as well as\nphysical and personal constraints of each pedestrian. Our method dynamically\nchanges the number of particles allocated to each pedestrian based on different\nconfidence metrics. Additionally, we use a new high-definition crowd video\ndataset, which is used to evaluate the performance of different pedestrian\ntracking algorithms. This dataset consists of videos of indoor and outdoor\nscenes, recorded at different locations with 30-80 pedestrians. We highlight\nthe performance benefits of our algorithm over prior techniques using this\ndataset. In practice, our algorithm can compute trajectories of tens of\npedestrians on a multi-core desktop CPU at interactive rates (27-30 frames per\nsecond). To the best of our knowledge, our approach is 4-5 times faster than\nprior methods, which provide similar accuracy.\n'

S'  In multiple instance learning, objects are sets (bags) of feature vectors\n(instances) rather than individual feature vectors. In this paper we address\nthe problem of how these bags can best be represented. Two standard approaches\nare to use (dis)similarities between bags and prototype bags, or between bags\nand prototype instances. The first approach results in a relatively\nlow-dimensional representation determined by the number of training bags, while\nthe second approach results in a relatively high-dimensional representation,\ndetermined by the total number of instances in the training set. In this paper\na third, intermediate approach is proposed, which links the two approaches and\ncombines their strengths. Our classifier is inspired by a random subspace\nensemble, and considers subspaces of the dissimilarity space, defined by\nsubsets of instances, as prototypes. We provide guidelines for using such an\nensemble, and show state-of-the-art performances on a range of multiple\ninstance learning problems.\n'

We show how the number of gallery images influences the\nclassification accuracy and execution time of the parallel algorithm. We\npresent the speedup and efficiency analyses that prove the efficacy of the\nparallel implementation. Noteworthy, different methods can be used at each step\nof our parallel framework. Here, we combine the shape contexts with the\nappearance-based techniques to enhance the robustness of the algorithm and to\nincrease the classification score. An extensive experimental study proves the\nsuperiority of the proposed approach over existing state-of-the-art methods.\n'

S"  ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters are integral membrane proteins that\nmediate the exchange of diverse substrates across membranes powered by ATP\nhydrolysis. We report results of coarse-grained dynamical simulations performed\nfor the bacterial heme transporter HmuUV. Based on the nucleotide-free\nstructure, we have constructed a ligand-elastic-network description for this\nprotein and investigated ATP-induced conformational motions in structurally\nresolved computer experiments. As we found, interactions with nucleotides\nresulted in generic motions which are functional and robust. Upon binding of\nATP-mimicking ligands the structure changed from a conformation in which the\nnucleotide-binding domains formed an open shape, to a conformation in which\nthey were found in tight contact and the transmembrane domains were rotated.\nThe heme channel was broadened in the ligand-bound complex and the gate to the\ncytoplasm, which was closed in the nucleotide-free conformation, was rendered\nopen by a mechanism that involved tilting motions of essential transmembrane\nhelices. Based on our findings we propose that the HmuUV transporter behaves\nlike a `simple' mechanical device in which, induced by binding of ATP ligands,\nlinear motions of the nucleotide-binding domains are translated into rotational\nmotions and internal tilting dynamics of the transmembrane domains that control\ngating inside the heme pathway.\n"

S'  We demonstrated fabrication of black silicon with slanted nanocone array on\nboth planar and 3D micro and meso scale structures produced by a\nhigh-throughput lithography-free oblique-angle plasma etching process.\nNanocones with gradual change in height were created on the same piece of\nsilicon. The relation between the slanted angle of nanocones and incident angle\nof directional plasma is experimentally investigated. In order to demonstrate\nthe monolithic integration of nanostructures on micro and meso scale non-planar\nsurfaces, nanocone forest is fabricated on non-planar silicon surfaces in\nvarious morphologies such as silicon atomic force microscopy (AFM) tips and\npyramidal pits. By integrating nanocones on inverse silicon micro-pyramid array\ndevices, we further improved the surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS)\nenhancement property of this optimized commercial SERS substrate by several\nfolds even when using 66% less noble metal coating. We investigated the length\ngradient dependence and asymmetric properties of SERS effects for slanted\nnanocone with polarized excitation. This versatile and angle-controllable\nnanocone fabrication and monolithic 3D nano-micro-meso integration method\nprovides new dimensions for production and optimization of SERS and other\nnanophotonic sensors.\n'

S'  Usually, we expect large particles to sediment faster than small of the same\nmaterial. Contrary to this intuition, we report a dynamical competition between\nsedimentation and phase ordering which leads to smaller particles settling\nfaster than larger ones. We access this phenomenon using suspensions of\npolymers and two colloidal species which we image with confocal microscopy.\nPolymers mediate attractions between colloids, leading to phase separation and\ncrystallisation. We find that the dynamical interplay between sedimentation,\nphase separation and crystal nucleation underlie this phenomenon. Furthermore,\nunder certain conditions we find a kinetic pathway leading to an apparent\ncoexistence between a one component crystal and binary fluid of equal buoyancy.\nThese findings may be relevant to the basic understanding of\nsedimentation-induced zone formation in nature and industrial applications.\n'

S'  In this paper, we consider learning dictionary models over a network of\nagents, where each agent is only in charge of a portion of the dictionary\nelements. This formulation is relevant in big data scenarios where multiple\nlarge dictionary models may be spread over different spatial locations and it\nis not feasible to aggregate all dictionaries in one location due to\ncommunication and privacy considerations. We first show that the dual function\nof the inference problem is an aggregation of individual cost functions\nassociated with different agents, which can then be minimized efficiently by\nmeans of diffusion strategies. The collaborative inference step generates the\ndual variables that are used by the agents to update their dictionaries without\nthe need to share these dictionaries or even the coefficient models for the\ntraining data. This is a powerful property that leads to a remarkably efficient\ndistributed procedure for learning dictionaries over large networks.\n'

S'  This paper explores combinatorial optimization for problems of max-weight\ngraph matching on multi-partite graphs, which arise in integrating multiple\ndata sources. Entity resolution-the data integration problem of performing\nnoisy joins on structured data-typically proceeds by first hashing each record\ninto zero or more blocks, scoring pairs of records that are co-blocked for\nsimilarity, and then matching pairs of sufficient similarity. In the most\ncommon case of matching two sources, it is often desirable for the final\nmatching to be one-to-one (a record may be matched with at most one other);\nmembers of the database and statistical record linkage communities accomplish\nsuch matchings in the final stage by weighted bipartite graph matching on\nsimilarity scores. Such matchings are intuitively appealing: they leverage a\nnatural global property of many real-world entity stores-that of being nearly\ndeduped-and are known to provide significant improvements to precision and\nrecall. Unfortunately unlike the bipartite case, exact max-weight matching on\nmulti-partite graphs is known to be NP-hard. Our two-fold algorithmic\ncontributions approximate multi-partite max-weight matching: our first\nalgorithm borrows optimization techniques common to Bayesian probabilistic\ninference; our second is a greedy approximation algorithm. In addition to a\ntheoretical guarantee on the latter, we present comparisons on a real-world ER\nproblem from Bing significantly larger than typically found in the literature,\npublication data, and on a series of synthetic problems. Our results quantify\nsignificant improvements due to exploiting multiple sources, which are made\npossible by global one-to-one constraints linking otherwise independent\nmatching sub-problems. We also discover that our algorithms are complementary:\none being much more robust under noise, and the other being simple to implement\nand very fast to run.\n'

In the proposed setup a Stark\nfield is used to bring the lower polariton branch in or out of resonance with a\nquasi-resonant continuous-wave laser, thereby favoring or inhibiting the\ninjection of polaritons into the cavity.

S'  Inertial microfluidics is a promising tool for many lab-on-a-chip\napplications. Particles in channel flows with Reynolds numbers above one\nundergo cross-streamline migration to a discrete set of equilibrium positions\nin square and rectangular channel cross sections. This effect has been used\nextensively for particle sorting and the analysis of particle properties. Using\nthe lattice Boltzmann method, we determine equilibrium positions in square and\nrectangular cross sections and classify their types of stability for different\nReynolds numbers, particle sizes, and channel aspect ratios. Our findings\nthereby help to design microfluidic channels for particle sorting. Furthermore,\nwe demonstrate how an axial control force, which slows down the particles,\nshifts the stable equilibrium position towards the channel center. Ultimately,\nthe particles then stay on the centerline for forces exceeding a threshold\nvalue. This effect is sensitive to particle size and channel Reynolds number\nand therefore suggests an efficient method for particle separation. In\ncombination with a hysteretic feedback scheme, we can even increase particle\nthroughput.\n'

S'  We present a fast direct algorithm for computing symmetric factorizations,\ni.e. $A = WW^T$, of symmetric positive-definite hierarchical matrices with\nweak-admissibility conditions. The computational cost for the symmetric\nfactorization scales as $\\mathcal{O}(n \\log^2 n)$ for hierarchically\noff-diagonal low-rank matrices. Once this factorization is obtained, the cost\nfor inversion, application, and determinant computation scales as\n$\\mathcal{O}(n \\log n)$. In particular, this allows for the near optimal\ngeneration of correlated random variates in the case where $A$ is a covariance\nmatrix. This symmetric factorization algorithm depends on two key ingredients.\nFirst, we present a novel symmetric factorization formula for low-rank updates\nto the identity of the form $I+UKU^T$. This factorization can be computed in\n$\\mathcal{O}(n)$ time, if the rank of the perturbation is sufficiently small.\nSecond, combining this formula with a recursive divide-and-conquer strategy,\nnear linear complexity symmetric factorizations for hierarchically structured\nmatrices can be obtained. We present numerical results for matrices relevant to\nproblems in probability \\& statistics (Gaussian processes), interpolation\n(Radial basis functions), and Brownian dynamics calculations in fluid mechanics\n(the Rotne-Prager-Yamakawa tensor).\n'

In the latter case, the full time dependent elastic response is in\nagreement with the theoretical prediction, obtained by solving the diffusion\nequation for the displacement field in an elastic medium.\n'

The optimal rates are shown to exhibit a phase\ntransition analogous to the i.i.d./statistical learning case, studied in\n(Rakhlin, Sridharan, Tsybakov 2013). In the frequently encountered situation\nwhen sequential entropy and i.i.d. empirical entropy match, our results point\nto the interesting phenomenon that the rates for statistical learning with\nsquared loss and online nonparametric regression are the same.\n  In addition to a non-algorithmic study of minimax regret, we exhibit a\ngeneric forecaster that enjoys the established optimal rates. We also provide a\nrecipe for designing online regression algorithms that can be computationally\nefficient. We illustrate the techniques by deriving existing and new\nforecasters for the case of finite experts and for online linear regression.\n'

This technique\nperforms better than state of art estimation techniques for this distribution.\nThis could be of particular use in low data or block based estimation problems.\nIn these scenarios, the estimator should be able to give accurate estimates in\nthe mean square sense with less amounts of data. Also, the estimates should\nimprove with the increase in number of blocks received. In this paper, we see\nthrough our simulations, that our proposal is well designed for such\nrequirements. Further, it is well known in the literature that an efficient\nestimator does not exist for Nakagami-m distribution. In this paper, we derive\na theoretical expression for the variance of our proposed estimator. We find\nthat this expression clearly fits the experimental curve for the variance of\nthe proposed estimator. This expression is pretty close to the cramer-rao lower\nbound(CRLB).\n'

S'  Recent experiments on nanoscale conductors coupled to microwave cavities put\nin prospect transport investigations of electron-photon interplay in the deep\nquantum regime. Here we propose a pump-probe scheme to investigate the\ntransient dynamics of individual electron-photon excitations in a double\nquantum dot-cavity system. Excitations pumped into the system decay via charge\ntunneling at the double dot, probed in real time. We investigate theoretically\nthe short-time charge transfer statistics at the dot, for periodic pumping, and\nshow that this gives access to vacuum Rabi oscillations as well as excitation\ndynamics in the presence of double dot dephasing and relaxation.\n'

S'  The nonlinear Fourier transform, which is also known as the forward\nscattering transform, decomposes a periodic signal into nonlinearly interacting\nwaves. In contrast to the common Fourier transform, these waves no longer have\nto be sinusoidal. Physically relevant waveforms are often available for the\nanalysis instead. The details of the transform depend on the waveforms\nunderlying the analysis, which in turn are specified through the implicit\nassumption that the signal is governed by a certain evolution equation. For\nexample, water waves generated by the Korteweg-de Vries equation can be\nexpressed in terms of cnoidal waves. Light waves in optical fiber governed by\nthe nonlinear Schr\\"dinger equation (NSE) are another example. Nonlinear\nanalogs of classic problems such as spectral analysis and filtering arise in\nmany applications, with information transmission in optical fiber, as proposed\nby Yousefi and Kschischang, being a very recent one. The nonlinear Fourier\ntransform is eminently suited to address them -- at least from a theoretical\npoint of view. Although numerical algorithms are available for computing the\ntransform, a "fast" nonlinear Fourier transform that is similarly effective as\nthe fast Fourier transform is for computing the common Fourier transform has\nnot been available so far. The goal of this paper is to address this problem.\nTwo fast numerical methods for computing the nonlinear Fourier transform with\nrespect to the NSE are presented. The first method achieves a runtime of\n$O(D^2)$ floating point operations, where $D$ is the number of sample points.\nThe second method applies only to the case where the NSE is defocusing, but it\nachieves a $O(D\\log^2D)$ runtime. Extensions of the results to other evolution\nequations are discussed as well.\n'

For specific\nplasma frequencies of the junctions a set of normal modes clusters in a narrow\nband and eventually become entirely degenerate.

S'  Cellular Automata (CA) are common and most simple models of parallel\ncomputations. Edge detection is one of the crucial task in image processing,\nespecially in processing biological and medical images. CA can be successfully\napplied in image processing. This paper presents a new method for edge\ndetection of binary images based on two dimensional twenty five neighborhood\ncellular automata. The method considers only linear rules of CA for extraction\nof edges under null boundary condition. The performance of this approach is\ncompared with some existing edge detection techniques. This comparison shows\nthat the proposed method to be very promising for edge detection of binary\nimages. All the algorithms and results used in this paper are prepared in\nMATLAB.\n'

S'  Two-dimensional (2D) crystals of semiconducting transition metal\ndichalcogenides (TMD) absorb a large fraction of incident photons in the\nvisible frequencies despite being atomically thin. It has been suggested that\nthe strong absorption is due to the parallel band or "band nesting" effect and\ncorresponding divergence in the joint density of states. Here, we show using\nphotoluminescence excitation spectroscopy that the band nesting in mono- and\nbilayer MX$_2$ (M = Mo, W and X = S, Se) results in excitation-dependent\ncharacteristic relaxation pathways of the photoexcited carriers. Our\nexperimental and simulation results reveal that photoexcited electron-hole\npairs in the nesting region spontaneously separate in the $k$-space, relaxing\ntowards immediate band extrema with opposite momentum. These effects imply that\nthe loss of photocarriers due to direct exciton recombination is temporarily\nsuppressed for excitation in resonance with band nesting. Our findings\nhighlight the potential for efficient hot carrier collection using these\nmaterials as the absorbers in optoelectronic devices.\n'

S"  The challenge of object categorization in images is largely due to arbitrary\ntranslations and scales of the foreground objects. To attack this difficulty,\nwe propose a new approach called collaborative receptive field learning to\nextract specific receptive fields (RF's) or regions from multiple images, and\nthe selected RF's are supposed to focus on the foreground objects of a common\ncategory. To this end, we solve the problem by maximizing a submodular function\nover a similarity graph constructed by a pool of RF candidates. However,\nmeasuring pairwise distance of RF's for building the similarity graph is a\nnontrivial problem. Hence, we introduce a similarity metric called\npyramid-error distance (PED) to measure their pairwise distances through\nsumming up pyramid-like matching errors over a set of low-level features.\nBesides, in consistent with the proposed PED, we construct a simple\nnonparametric classifier for classification. Experimental results show that our\nmethod effectively discovers the foreground objects in images, and improves\nclassification performance.\n"

We prove in\nparticular that staircasing always occurs at global extrema of the datum and at\nall extrema of the minimizer. It is also shown that, for radial images, the\nstaircasing always appears at the extrema and at the boundary of the image. We\nalso prove the equivalence between the denoising model and the total variation\nflow, in the radial case, thus extending a previous result in dimension one.\nThis equivalence cannot hold in the nonradial case, as it is shown with a\ncounterexample. This connection allows us to understand how the staircase zones\nand the discontinuities of the denoising problem evolve with the regularization\nparameter.\n'

Experimental\nresults show that performance of the proposed approach is higher than those of\nstate-of-the-art approaches.

S'  Cross-language learning allows us to use training data from one language to\nbuild models for a different language. Many approaches to bilingual learning\nrequire that we have word-level alignment of sentences from parallel corpora.\nIn this work we explore the use of autoencoder-based methods for cross-language\nlearning of vectorial word representations that are aligned between two\nlanguages, while not relying on word-level alignments. We show that by simply\nlearning to reconstruct the bag-of-words representations of aligned sentences,\nwithin and between languages, we can in fact learn high-quality representations\nand do without word alignments. Since training autoencoders on word\nobservations presents certain computational issues, we propose and compare\ndifferent variations adapted to this setting. We also propose an explicit\ncorrelation maximizing regularizer that leads to significant improvement in the\nperformance. We empirically investigate the success of our approach on the\nproblem of cross-language test classification, where a classifier trained on a\ngiven language (e.g., English) must learn to generalize to a different language\n(e.g., German). These experiments demonstrate that our approaches are\ncompetitive with the state-of-the-art, achieving up to 10-14 percentage point\nimprovements over the best reported results on this task.\n'

To obtain MFP spectra, the measurements must be interpreted within\nthe framework of the frequency-dependent Boltzmann transport equation (BTE),\nbut previous solutions have restricted validity due to simplifying assumptions.\nHere, we analyze heat conduction in TG using a new analytical solution of the\nfrequency-dependent BTE that accurately describes thermal transport from the\ndiffusive to ballistic regimes. We demonstrate that our result enables a more\naccurate measurement of MFP spectra and thus will lead to an improved\nunderstanding of heat conduction in solids.\n'

The photoresponse\nincreased linearly with increasing radiation power up to kW/cm^2 range. The\nsaturation of the photoresponse was observed for all investigated field effect\ntransistors for intensities above several kW/cm^2.

S'  We investigate the behavior of the Generalized Likelihood Ratio Test (GLRT)\n(Fan, Zhang and Zhang [Ann. Statist. 29 (2001) 153-193]) for time varying\ncoefficient models where the regressors and errors are non-stationary time\nseries and can be cross correlated. It is found that the GLRT retains the\nminimax rate of local alternative detection under weak dependence and\nnon-stationarity. However, in general, the Wilks phenomenon as well as the\nclassic residual bootstrap are sensitive to either conditional\nheteroscedasticity of the errors, non-stationarity or temporal dependence. An\naveraged test is suggested to alleviate the sensitivity of the test to the\nchoice of bandwidth and is shown to be more powerful than tests based on a\nsingle bandwidth. An alternative wild bootstrap method is proposed and shown to\nbe consistent when making inference of time varying coefficient models for\nnon-stationary time series.\n'

S'  Planar, double-torsional oscillators are especially suitable for short-range\nmacroscopic force search experiments, since they can be operated at the limit\nof instrumental thermal noise. As a study of this limit, we report a\nmeasurement of the noise kinetic energy of a polycrystalline tungsten\noscillator in thermal equilibrium at room temperature. The fluctuations of the\noscillator in a high-Q torsional mode with a resonance frequency near 1 kHz are\ndetected with capacitive transducers coupled to a sensitive differential\namplifier. The electronic processing is calibrated by means of a known\nelectrostatic force and input from a finite element model. The measured average\nkinetic energy is in agreement with the expected value of 1/2 kT.\n'

Using the Taylor expansion method that one of us developed,\nwe analyze a series of simple situations (1D and 2D) for diffusion and for\nlinear fluid problems using bounce-back and "anti bounce-back" numerical\nboundary conditions. The result is that "magic parameters" depend upon the\ndetailed choice of the moments and of their equilibrium values. They may also\ndepend upon the way the flow is driven.\n'

S'  Proton computed tomography (pCT) is a novel imaging modality developed for\npatients receiving proton radiation therapy. The purpose of this work was to\ninvestigate hull-detection algorithms used for preconditioning of the large and\nsparse linear system of equations that needs to be solved for pCT image\nreconstruction. The hull-detection algorithms investigated here included\nsilhouette/space carving (SC), modified silhouette/space carving (MSC), and\nspace modeling (SM). Each was compared to the cone-beam version of filtered\nbackprojection (FBP) used for hull-detection. Data for testing these algorithms\nincluded simulated data sets of a digital head phantom and an experimental data\nset of a pediatric head phantom obtained with a pCT scanner prototype at Loma\nLinda University Medical Center. SC was the fastest algorithm, exceeding the\nspeed of FBP by more than 100 times. FBP was most sensitive to the presence of\nnoise. Ongoing work will focus on optimizing threshold parameters in order to\ndefine a fast and efficient method for hull-detection in pCT image\nreconstruction.\n'

S'  Recently, we proposed quantum language (or, measurement theory), which is\ncharacterized as the linguistic turn of the Copenhagen interpretation of\nquantum mechanics. We believe that this language has a great powet of\ndescription, and therefore, even statistics can be described by quantum\nlanguage. In this paper, we show that ANOVA (analysis of variance (one-way and\ntwo-way)) can be formulated in quantum language. Since quantum language is\nsuited for theoretical arguments, we believe that our results are visible and\nunderstandable. For example, we can answer the question "What kind of role does\nKolmogorov\'s probability theory play in ANOVA?" That is, the readers find that\nKolmogorov\'s probability theory is merely used in order to calculate\nmulti-dimenstional Gauss integrals, and thus, they can avoid to confuse the\nrelation between Kolmogorov\'s probability theory and statistics.\n'

S'  Recently a new class of techniques termed the max-plus curse of\ndimensionality-free methods have been developed to solve nonlinear optimal\ncontrol problems. In these methods the discretization in state space is avoided\nby using a max-plus basis expansion of the value function. This requires\nstoring only the coefficients of the basis functions used for representation.\nHowever, the number of basis functions grows exponentially with respect to the\nnumber of time steps of propagation to the time horizon of the control problem.\nThis so called "curse of complexity" can be managed by applying a pruning\nprocedure which selects the subset of basis functions that contribute most to\nthe approximation of the value function. The pruning procedures described thus\nfar in the literature rely on the solution of a sequence of high dimensional\noptimization problems which can become computationally expensive.\n  In this paper we show that if the max-plus basis functions are linear and the\nregion of interest in state space is convex, the pruning problem can be\nefficiently solved by the bundle method. This approach combining the bundle\nmethod and semidefinite formulations is applied to the quantum gate synthesis\nproblem, in which the state space is the special unitary group (which is\nnon-convex). This is based on the observation that the convexification of the\nunitary group leads to an exact relaxation. The results are studied and\nvalidated via examples.\n'

The nature of the wakefields (pure excitonic or\npolaritonic) can be controled by changing the speed of propagation of the\nexternal pump. This process could be used as a diagnostic for the internal\nparameters of the microcavity.\n'

S'  Given a hypothesis space, the large volume principle by Vladimir Vapnik\nprioritizes equivalence classes according to their volume in the hypothesis\nspace. The volume approximation has hitherto been successfully applied to\nbinary learning problems. In this paper, we extend it naturally to a more\ngeneral definition which can be applied to several transductive problem\nsettings, such as multi-class, multi-label and serendipitous learning. Even\nthough the resultant learning method involves a non-convex optimization\nproblem, the globally optimal solution is almost surely unique and can be\nobtained in O(n^3) time. We theoretically provide stability and error analyses\nfor the proposed method, and then experimentally show that it is promising.\n'

S'  We use experiments to study the dynamics of the healing of a blister, a\nlocalized bump in a thin elastic layer that is adhered to a soft substrate\neverywhere except at the bump. We create a blister by gently placing a glass\ncover slip on a PDMS substrate. The pressure jump across the elastic layer\ndrives fluid flow through micro-channels that form at the interface between the\nlayer and the substrate; these channels coalesce at discrete locations as the\nblister heals and eventually disappear at a lower critical radius. The spacing\nof the channel follows a simple scaling law that can be theoretically\njustified, and the kinetics of healing is rate limited by fluid flow, but with\na non-trivial dependence on the substrate thickness that likely arises due to\nchannelization. Our study is relevant to a variety of soft adhesion scenarios.\n'

S'  Using Monte Carlo simulation, we study a fluid of two-dimensional hard rods\ninside a small circular cavity bounded by a hard wall, from the dilute regime\nto the high-density, layering regime. Both planar and homeotropic anchoring of\nthe nematic director can be induced at the walls through a free-energy penalty.\nThe circular geometry creates frustration in the nematic phase and a\npolar-symmetry configuration with a distorted director field plus two $+1/2$\ndisclinations is created. At higher densities, a quasi-uniform structure is\nobserved with a (minimal) director distortion which is relaxed via the\nformation of orientational domain walls. This novel structure is not predicted\nby elasticity theory and is similar to the step-like structures observed in\nthree-dimensional hybrid slit pores. We speculate that the formation of domain\nwalls is a general mechanism to relax elastic stresses in conditions of strong\nsurface anchoring and severe spatial confinement.\n'

S'  In this paper, we present a block-oriented scheme for adaptive mesh\nrefinement based on summation-by-parts (SBP) finite difference methods and\nsimultaneous-approximation-term (SAT) interface treatment. Since the order of\naccuracy at SBP-SAT grid interfaces is lower compared to that of the interior\nstencils, we strive at using the interior stencils across block-boundaries\nwhenever possible. We devise a stable treatment of SBP-FD junction points, i.e.\npoints where interfaces with different boundary treatment meet. This leads to\nstable discretizations for more flexible grid configurations within the SBP-SAT\nframework, with a reduced number of SBP-SAT interfaces. Both first and second\nderivatives are considered in the analysis. Even though the stencil order is\nlocally reduced close to numerical interfaces and corner points, numerical\nsimulations show that the locally reduced accuracy does not severely reduce the\naccuracy of the time propagated numerical solution. Moreover, we explain how to\norganize the grid and how to automatically adapt the mesh, aiming at problems\nof many variables. Examples of adaptive grids are demonstrated for the\nsimulation of the time-dependent Schr\\"odinger equation and for the advection\nequation.\n'

The architecture consists of a sensor of a\nsingle detector element and an aperture assembly of an array of aperture\nelements, each of which has a programmable transmittance. This lensless\ncompressive imaging architecture can be used in conjunction with compressive\nsensing to capture images in a compressed form of compressive measurements. In\nthis paper, we perform noise analysis of this lensless compressive imaging\narchitecture and compare it with pinhole aperture imaging and lens aperture\nimaging. We will show that the SNR in the lensless compressive imaging is\nindependent of the image resolution, while that in either pinhole aperture\nimaging or lens aperture imaging decreases as the image resolution increases.\nConsequently, the SNR in the lensless compressive imaging can be much higher if\nthe image resolution is large enough.\n'

S'  The approximation of $e^{tA}B$ where $A$ is a large sparse matrix and $B$ a\nrectangular matrix is the key ingredient in many scientific and engineering\ncomputations. A powerful tool to manage the matrix exponential function is to\nresort to a suitable rational approximation such as the Carath$\\acute{\\rm\ne}$odory-Fej$\\acute{\\rm e}$r approximation, whose core reduces to solve shifted\nlinear systems with multiple right-hand sides. The restarted and shifted block\nFOM algorithm is a commonly used technique for this problem. However,\ndetermining good preconditioners for shifted systems that preserve the original\nstructure is a difficult task. In this paper, we propose a new preconditioner\nfor the restarted and shifted block FOM algorithm. The key is that the absolute\nvalues of the poles of the Carath$\\acute{\\rm e}$odory-Fej$\\acute{\\rm e}$r\napproximation are medium sized and can be much smaller than the norm of the\nmatrix in question. The advantages of the proposed strategy are that we can\nprecondition all the shifted linear systems simultaneously, and preserve the\noriginal structure of the shifted linear systems after restarting. Theoretical\nresults are provided to show the rationality of our preconditioning strategy.\nApplications of the new approach to Toeplitz matrix exponential problem are\nalso discussed. Numerical experiments illustrate the superiority of the new\nalgorithm over many state-of-the-art algorithms for matrix exponential.\n'

We check the quantitative validity of our\ntheory by comparison to numerical transfer matrix computations.\n'

We derive the modified fluctuation relation for the heat in the\noverdamped Langevin system. It shows that mutual correlations among the work,\nthe heat, and the internal energy change are responsible for the different\nfluctuation property of the work and the heat. The mutual correlation is\ninvestigated in detail in a two-dimensional linear diffusion system. We develop\nan analytic method which allows one to calculate the large deviation function\nfor the joint probability distributions. We find that the heat and the internal\nenergy change have a negative correlation, which explains the reason for the\nbreakdown of the fluctuation theorem for the heat.\n'

S'  We consider the problem of detecting an epidemic in a population where\nindividual diagnoses are extremely noisy. The motivation for this problem is\nthe plethora of examples (influenza strains in humans, or computer viruses in\nsmartphones, etc.) where reliable diagnoses are scarce, but noisy data\nplentiful. In flu/phone-viruses, exceedingly few infected people/phones are\nprofessionally diagnosed (only a small fraction go to a doctor) but less\nreliable secondary signatures (e.g., people staying home, or\ngreater-than-typical upload activity) are more readily available. These\nsecondary data are often plagued by unreliability: many people with the flu do\nnot stay home, and many people that stay home do not have the flu. This paper\nidentifies the precise regime where knowledge of the contact network enables\nfinding the needle in the haystack: we provide a distributed, efficient and\nrobust algorithm that can correctly identify the existence of a spreading\nepidemic from highly unreliable local data. Our algorithm requires only\nlocal-neighbor knowledge of this graph, and in a broad array of settings that\nwe describe, succeeds even when false negatives and false positives make up an\noverwhelming fraction of the data available. Our results show it succeeds in\nthe presence of partial information about the contact network, and also when\nthere is not a single "patient zero", but rather many (hundreds, in our\nexamples) of initial patient-zeroes, spread across the graph.\n'

S'  It is hard to overstate the importance of multidimensional scaling as an\nanalysis technique in the broad sciences. Classical, or Torgerson\nmultidimensional scaling is one of the main variants, with the advantage that\nit has a closed-form analytic solution. However, this solution is exact if and\nonly if the distances are Euclidean. Conversely, there has been comparatively\nlittle discussion on what to do in the presence of negative eigenvalues: the\nintuitive solution, prima facie justifiable in least-squares terms, is to take\nevery positive eigenvector as a dimension. We show that this, minimizing\nleast-squares to the centred distances instead of the true distances, is\nsuboptimal - throwing away positive eigenvectors can decrease the error even as\nwe project to fewer dimensions. We provide provably better methods for handling\nthis common case.\n'

S'  In tunnel junctions with ferroelectric barriers, switching the polarization\ndirection modifies the electrostatic potential profile and the associated\naverage tunnel barrier height. This results in strong changes of the tunnel\ntransmission and associated resistance. The information readout in\nferroelectric tunnel junctions (FTJs) is thus resistive and non-destructive,\nwhich is an advantage compared to the case of conventional ferroelectric\nmemories (FeRAMs). Initially, endurance limitation (i.e. fatigue) was the main\nfactor hampering the industrialization of FeRAMs. Systematic investigations of\nswitching dynamics for various ferroelectric and electrode materials have\nresolved this issue, with endurance now reaching $10^{14}$ cycles. Here we\ninvestigate data retention and endurance in fully patterned submicron\nCo/BiFeO$_3$/Ca$_{0.96}$Ce$_{0.04}$MnO$_3$ FTJs. We report good reproducibility\nwith high resistance contrasts and extend the maximum reported endurance of\nFTJs by three orders of magnitude ($4\\times10^6$ cycles). Our results indicate\nthat here fatigue is not limited by a decrease of the polarization or an\nincrease of the leakage but rather by domain wall pinning. We propose\ndirections to access extreme and intermediate resistance states more reliably\nand further strengthen the potential of FTJs for non-volatile memory\napplications.\n'

Using molecular dynamics simulations, we investigate how\nactive solutes perturb osmotic steady states. We find that solute activity\nincreases the osmotic pressure, and can also expel solvent from the solution -\ni.e. cause reverse osmosis. The latter effect cannot be described by an\neffective temperature, but can be reproduced by mapping the active solution\nonto a passive one with the same degree of local structuring as the passive\nsolvent component. Our results provide a basic framework for understanding\nactive osmosis, and suggest that activity-induced structuring of the passive\ncomponent may play a key role in the physics of active-passive mixtures.\n'

The model is derived using the Wigner transform and Weyl quantization,\nand the central idea is to evolve the entire Wigner matrix rather than just the\ndiagonal entries as was done previously in the adiabatic case. The off-diagonal\nentries of the Wigner matrix suitably describe the non-adiabatic transition,\nsuch as the Berry connection, for avoided crossings. We study the numerical\napproximation issues of the model, and then conduct numerical experiments to\nvalidate the model.\n'

S'  It is well established that a correlated quantum impurity embedded in a\nmetallic host can form the many-body Kondo state with itinerant electrons due\nto the effective antiferromagnetic coupling. Such effect is manifested\nspectroscopically by a narrow Abrikosov-Suhl peak appearing at the Fermi level\nbelow a characteristic temperature T_K. Recent experiments using nanoscopic\nheterojunctions where the correlated quantum impurities (dots) are coupled to\nsuperconducting reservoirs revealed that the Kondo-type correlations are\nsubstantially weaker because: i) the single-particle states of superconductors\nare depleted around the Fermi level and ii) the on-dot pairing (proximity\neffect) competes with the spin ordering. Within the Anderson impurity scenario\nwe study here influence of such induced on-dot paring on the exchange\ninteraction adopting the continuous unitary transformation, which goes beyond\nthe perturbative framework. Our analytical and numerical results show strong\ndetrimental influence of the electron pairing on the effective\nantiferromagnetic coupling thereby suppressing the Kondo temperature in\nagreement with the experimental observations.\n'

S'  In the diagnosis of autoimmune diseases, an important task is to classify\nimages of slides containing several HEp-2 cells. All cells from one slide share\nthe same label, and by classifying cells from one slide independently, some\ninformation on the global image quality and intensity is lost. Considering one\nwhole slide as a collection (a bag) of feature vectors, however, poses the\nproblem of how to handle this bag. A simple, and surprisingly effective,\napproach is to summarize the bag of feature vectors by a few quantile values\nper feature. This characterizes the full distribution of all instances, thereby\nassuming that all instances in a bag are informative. This representation is\nparticularly useful when each bag contains many feature vectors, which is the\ncase in the classification of the immunofluorescence images. Experiments on the\nclassification of indirect immunofluorescence images show the usefulness of\nthis approach.\n'

S'  Investigations of quantum mechanical effects in macroscopic systems are of\ngreat interest to shed light onto the question where and how the transition to\nthe classical world appears. It is also of practical relevance to determine if\na bath dephasing a qubit can be described classically or requires a quantum\nmechanical treatment. We propose a measurement scheme to detect quantum\nbackaction via correlation measurements to answer this question for a bath\ncoupled to a single qubit. The presence of backaction leads to a dependence of\ncorrelations of subsequent initialization-evolution-readout cycles on how the\nqubit is manipulated in between. We compute the autocorrelation function for\nboth an instructive spin model and the realistic case of an electron spin\ncoupled to a bath of $10^6$ nuclear spins, as found in gated GaAs quantum dots,\nand show that backaction from the qubit onto the nuclear spin bath should be\ndetectable even in such a large system.\n'

Probability distribution functions reflect the\nvalue of the loop exponent of the entropic interaction.

S'  Adhesive forces are capable of deforming a soft elastic object when it comes\nin contact with a flat rigid substrate. The contact is in stable equilibrium if\nthe total energy of the system arising from the elastic and surface forces\nexhibits a minimum at a zero or at a slightly negative load. However, as the\nsystem is continually unloaded, the energy barrier decreases and it eventually\ndisappears, thus leading to a ballistic separation of the contact. While this\ntype of contact splitting has received wide recognition, what has not been much\nappreciated with these types of soft adhesion problems is that rupture of a\ncontact can also occur at any finite sub critical load in the presence of a\nnoise. The soft contact problems are unique in that the noise can be a-thermal,\nwhereas the metastable and stable states of the thermodynamic potential can\narise from the competition of the elastic and the inter-facial energies of the\nsystem. Analysis based on activated rate theory and simulations based on\nstochastic dynamics show that the contact rupture dynamics is amenable to a\nforce and noise induced escape of a particle from a potential well that is\ngeneric to various types of colloidal and macromolecular processes. These ideas\nare useful in understanding the results of a recent experiment involving the\nnoise activated rolling dynamics of a rigid sphere on a surface, where it is\npinned by soft micro-fibrils.\n'

S'  The kappa_SQ software package is designed to assist researchers working on\nrandomized row sampling. The package contains a collection of Matlab functions\nalong with a GUI that ties them all together and provides a platform for the\nuser to perform experiments. In particular, kappa_SQ is designed to do\nexperiments related to the two-norm condition number of a sampled matrix,\n$\\kappa(SQ)$, where $S$ is a row sampling matrix and $Q$ is a tall and skinny\nmatrix with orthonormal columns. Via a simple GUI, kappa_SQ can generate test\nmatrices, perform various types of row sampling, measure $\\kappa(SQ)$,\ncalculate bounds and produce high quality plots of the results. All of the\nimportant codes are written in separate Matlab function files in a standard\nformat which makes it easy for a user to either use the codes by themselves or\nincorporate their own codes into the kappa_SQ package.\n'

S'  The thermal response of a Cu-Ti double-layered film is investigated after\nlaser irradiation with ultrashort pulses (pulse duration {\\tau}p=50fs, 800nm\nlaser wavelength) in submelting conditions by including the influence of\nnonthermal electrons. A revised two-temperature model is employed to account\nfor the contribution of nonthermal electron distribution while the variation of\nthe optical properties of the material during the laser beam irradiation is\nalso incorporated into the model. Theoretical results can provide significant\ninsight into the physical mechanism that characterize electron dynamics and can\nfacilitate production of controllable ultra-high strength Cu-Ti alloys with\npromising applications.\n'

S"  We infer the high-frequency flux noise spectrum in a superconducting flux\nqubit by studying the decay of Rabi oscillations under strong driving\nconditions. The large anharmonicity of the qubit and its strong inductive\ncoupling to a microwave line enabled high-amplitude driving without causing\nsignificant additional decoherence. Rabi frequencies up to 1.7 GHz were\nachieved, approaching the qubit's level splitting of 4.8 GHz, a regime where\nthe rotating-wave approximation breaks down as a model for the driven dynamics.\nThe spectral density of flux noise observed in the wide frequency range\ndecreases with increasing frequency up to 300 MHz, where the spectral density\nis not very far from the extrapolation of the 1/f spectrum obtained from the\nfree-induction-decay measurements. We discuss a possible origin of the flux\nnoise due to surface electron spins.\n"

S'  We theoretically investigate general properties of driven (sheared) colloidal\nsuspensions in confinement, based on methods of classical density functional\ntheory. In the absence of an exact closed (Smoluchowski-) equation for the\none-particle density under shear, we formulate a set of general conditions for\napproximations, and show that a simple closure fulfills them. The exact\nmicroscopic stress tensor is identified. Exemplifying the situation near a wall\n(oriented parallel to the direction of shear), we note that the microscopic\nshear stress is not necessarily homogeneous. Formulating a second equation\nadditional to the Smoluchowski equation, we achieve a homogeneous shear stress,\nand thereby compute the local flow velocity near the wall. This finally leads\nto a slip length of the complex fluid at the wall.\n'

S'  Quenched disorder affects significantly the behavior of phase transitions.\nThe Imry-Ma-Aizenman-Wehr-Berker argument prohibits first-order or\ndiscontinuous transitions and their concomitant phase coexistence in\nlow-dimensional equilibrium systems in the presence of random fields. Instead,\ndiscontinuous transitions become rounded or even continuous once disorder is\nintroduced. Here we show that phase coexistence and first-order phase\ntransitions are also precluded in nonequilibrium low-dimensional systems with\nquenched disorder: discontinuous transitions in two-dimensional systems with\nabsorbing states become continuous in the presence of quenched disorder. We\nalso study the universal features of this disorder-induced criticality and find\nthem to be compatible with the universality class of the directed percolation\nwith quenched disorder. Thus, we conclude that first-order transitions do not\nexist in low-dimensional disordered systems, not even in genuinely\nnonequilibrium systems with absorbing states.\n'

S'  We propose efficient algorithms based on a band-limited version of 2D\nsynchrosqueezed transforms to extract mesoscopic and microscopic information\nfrom atomic crystal images. The methods analyze atomic crystal images as an\nassemblage of non-overlapping segments of 2D general intrinsic mode type\nfunctions, which are superpositions of non-linear wave-like components. In\nparticular, crystal defects are interpreted as the irregularity of local\nenergy; crystal rotations are described as the angle deviation of local wave\nvectors from their references; the gradient of a crystal elastic deformation\ncan be obtained by a linear system generated by local wave vectors. Several\nnumerical examples of synthetic and real crystal images are provided to\nillustrate the efficiency, robustness, and reliability of our methods.\n'

S"  In this paper we address the temporal energy growth associated with numerical\napproximations of the perfectly matched layer (PML) for Maxwell's equations in\nfirst order form. In the literature, several studies have shown that a\nnumerical method which is stable in the absence of the PML can become unstable\nwhen the PML is introduced. We demonstrate in this paper that this instability\ncan be directly related to numerical treatment of boundary conditions in the\nPML. First, at the continuous level, we establish the stability of the constant\ncoefficient initial boundary value problem for the PML. To enable the\nconstruction of stable numerical boundary procedures, we derive energy\nestimates for the variable coefficient PML. Second, we develop a high order\naccurate and stable numerical approximation for the PML using\nsummation--by--parts finite difference operators to approximate spatial\nderivatives and weak enforcement of boundary conditions using penalties. By\nconstructing analogous discrete energy estimates we show discrete stability and\nconvergence of the numerical method. Numerical experiments verify the\ntheoretical results\n"

S'  We examine the problem of computing multivariate scenarios sets for skewed\ndistributions. Our interest is motivated by the potential use of such sets in\nthe "stress testing" of insurance companies and banks whose solvency is\ndependent on changes in a set of financial "risk factors". We define\nmultivariate scenario sets based on the notion of half-space depth (HD) and\nalso introduce the notion of expectile depth (ED) where half-spaces are defined\nby expectiles rather than quantiles. We then use the HD and ED functions to\ndefine convex scenario sets that generalize the concepts of quantile and\nexpectile to higher dimensions. In the case of elliptical distributions these\nsets coincide with the regions encompassed by the contours of the density\nfunction. In the context of multivariate skewed distributions, the equivalence\nof depth contours and density contours does not hold in general. We consider\ntwo parametric families that account for skewness and heavy tails: the\ngeneralized hyperbolic and the skew-t distributions. By making use of a\ncanonical form representation, where skewness is completely absorbed by one\ncomponent, we show that the HD contours of these distributions are\n"near-elliptical" and, in the case of the skew-Cauchy distribution, we prove\nthat the HD contours are exactly elliptical. We propose a measure of\nmultivariate skewness as a deviation from angular symmetry and show that it can\nexplain the quality of the elliptical approximation for the HD contours.\n'

Exponentially tempering\nthe probability of large jumps of L\\\'{e}vy flights leads to the tempered stable\nL\\\'{e}vy processes which combine both the $\\alpha$-stable and Gaussian trends;\nand the very large jumps are unlikely and all their moments exist. The\nprobability density functions of the tempered stable L\\\'{e}vy processes solve\nthe tempered fractional diffusion equation. This paper focuses on designing the\nhigh order difference schemes for the tempered fractional diffusion equation on\nbounded domain. The high order difference approximations, called the tempered\nand weighted and shifted Gr\\"{u}nwald difference (tempered-WSGD) operators, in\nspace are obtained by using the properties of the tempered fractional calculus\nand weighting and shifting their first order Gr\\"{u}nwald type difference\napproximations. And the Crank-Nicolson discretization is used in the time\ndirection. The stability and convergence of the presented numerical schemes are\nestablished; and the numerical experiments are performed to confirm the\ntheoretical results and testify the effectiveness of the schemes.\n'

Our\napproach is based on resonant wave-wave interaction theory. We show that the\nroute to thermalization consists of three stages. The first one is associated\nwith non-resonant three-wave interactions. At this short time scale, the\ndynamics is reversible; this stage coincides with the observation of recurrent\nphenomena in numerical simulations of the $\\alpha$-FPU. On a larger time scale,\nexact four-wave resonant interactions start to take place; however, we find\nthat all quartets are isolated, preventing a full mixing of energy in the\nspectrum and thermalization. The last stage corresponds to six-wave resonant\ninteractions. Those are responsible for the energy equipartition recently\nobserved in numerical simulations. A key role in our finding is played by the\n{\\it Umklapp} (flip over) resonant interactions, typical of discrete systems.\n'
