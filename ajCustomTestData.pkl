S'  This paper is a continuation of [7] where we prove a characterization of the\nsupport in H\\"older norm of the law of the solution to a stochastic wave\nequation with three-dimensional space variable and null initial conditions.\nHere we allow for non null initial conditions and therefore the solution does\nnot possess a stationary property in space. As in [7], the support theorem is a\nconsequence of an approximation result, in the convergence of probability, of a\nsequence of evolution equations driven by a family of regularizations of the\ndriving noise. However, the method of the proof differs from [7] since\narguments based on the stationarity property of the solution cannot be used.\n'

S"  We apply the techniques developed in Comets and Popov (2003) to present a new\nproof to Sinai's theorem (Sinai, 1982) on one-dimensional random walk in random\nenvironment (RWRE), working in a scale-free way to avoid rescaling arguments\nand splitting the proof in two independent parts: a quenched one, related to\nthe measure $P_\\omega$ conditioned on a fixed, typical realization $\\omega$ of\nthe environment, and an annealed one, related to the product measure\n$\\mathbb{P}$ of the environment $\\omega$. The quenched part still holds even if\nwe use another measure (possibly dependent) for the environment.\n"

S'  We unconditionally prove a central limit theorem for linear statistics of the\nzeros of the Riemann zeta function with diverging variance. Previously,\ntheorems of this sort have been proved under the assumption of the Riemann\nhypothesis. The result mirrors central limit theorems in random matrix theory\nthat have been proved by Szeg\\H{o}, Spohn, and Soshnikov among others, and\ntherefore provides support for the view that the zeros of the zeta function are\ndistributed like the eigenvalues of a random matrix.\n  A key ingredient in our proof is a simple bootstrapping of classical zero\ndensity estimates of Selberg and Jutila for the zeta function, which may be of\nindependent interest.\n'

S'  A bounded curvature path is a continuously differentiable piecewise $C^2$\npath with bounded absolute curvature that connects two points in the tangent\nbundle of a surface. In this note we give necessary and sufficient conditions\nfor two bounded curvature paths, defined in the Euclidean plane, to be in the\nsame connected component while keeping the curvature bounded at every stage of\nthe deformation. Following our previous results here we finish a program\nstarted by Lester Dubins in 1961.\n'

S'  Let $X$ be a product of locally compact rank one Hadamard spaces and $\\Gamma$\na discrete group of isometries which contains two elements projecting to a pair\nof independent rank one isometries in each factor. In [arXiv:1308.5584] we gave\na precise description of the structure of the geometric limit set of $\\Gamma$;\nour aim in this paper is to describe this set from a measure theoretical point\nof view, using as a basic tool the properties of the exponent of growth of\n$\\Gamma$ established in the aforementioned article. We first show that the\nconformal density obtained from the classical Patterson-Sullivan construction\nis supported in a unique $\\Gamma$-invariant subset of the geometric limit set;\ngeneralizing this classical construction we then obtain measures supported in\neach $\\Gamma$-invariant subset of the regular limit set and investigate their\nproperties.\n  We remark that apart from Kac-Moody groups over finite fields acting on the\nDavis complex of their associated twin building, the probably most interesting\nexamples to which our results apply are isometry groups of reducible\nCAT(0)-cube complexes without Euclidean factors.\n'

S'  We consider a square random matrix of size N of the form A + Y where A is\ndeterministic and Y has iid entries with variance 1/N. Under mild assumptions,\nas N grows, the empirical distribution of the eigenvalues of A+Y converges\nweakly to a limit probability measure \\beta on the complex plane. This work is\ndevoted to the study of the outlier eigenvalues, i.e. eigenvalues in the\ncomplement of the support of \\beta. Even in the simplest cases, a variety of\ninteresting phenomena can occur. As in earlier works, we give a sufficient\ncondition to guarantee that outliers are stable and provide examples where\ntheir fluctuations vary with the particular distribution of the entries of Y or\nthe Jordan decomposition of A. We also exhibit concrete examples where the\noutlier eigenvalues converge in distribution to the zeros of a Gaussian\nanalytic function.\n'

Using results from the theory of the weak convergence of\n$\\sigma$-fields, we first establish a semimartingale convergence theorem. Then\nwe apply it in a filtration expansion with a process setting and provide\nsufficient conditions for a semimartingale of the base filtration to remain a\nsemimartingale in the expanded filtration. Applications to the expansion of a\nBrownian filtration are given. The paper concludes with applications to models\nof insider trading in financial mathematics.\n'

S"  Consider a multidimensional diffusion process $X=\\{X\\left(t\\right)\n:t\\in\\lbrack0,1]\\}$. Let $\\varepsilon>0$ be a \\textit{deterministic}, user\ndefined, tolerance error parameter. Under standard regularity conditions on the\ndrift and diffusion coefficients of $X$, we construct a probability space,\nsupporting both $X$ and an explicit, piecewise constant, fully simulatable\nprocess $X_{\\varepsilon}$ such that \\[ \\sup_{0\\leq t\\leq1}\\left\\Vert\nX_{\\varepsilon}\\left(t\\right) -X\\left(t\\right) \\right\\Vert_{\\infty}<\\varepsilon\n\\] with probability one.

S"  In this paper we describe a perfect simulation algorithm for the stable\n$M/G/c$ queue. Sigman (2011: Exact Simulation of the Stationary Distribution of\nthe FIFO M/G/c Queue. Journal of Applied Probability, 48A, 209--213) showed how\nto build a dominated CFTP algorithm for perfect simulation of the super-stable\n$M/G/c$ queue operating under First Come First Served discipline, with\ndominating process provided by the corresponding $M/G/1$ queue (using Wolff's\nsample path monotonicity, which applies when service durations are coupled in\norder of initiation of service), and exploiting the fact that the workload\nprocess for the $M/G/1$ queue remains the same under different queueing\ndisciplines, in particular under the Processor Sharing discipline, for which a\ndynamic reversibility property holds. We generalize Sigman's construction to\nthe stable case by comparing the $M/G/c$ queue to a copy run under Random\nAssignment. This allows us to produce a naive perfect simulation algorithm\nbased on running the dominating process back to the time it first empties. We\nalso construct a more efficient algorithm that uses sandwiching by lower and\nupper processes constructed as coupled $M/G/c$ queues started respectively from\nthe empty state and the state of the $M/G/c$ queue under Random Assignment. A\ncareful analysis shows that appropriate ordering relationships can still be\nmaintained, so long as service durations continue to be coupled in order of\ninitiation of service. We summarize statistical checks of simulation output,\nand demonstrate that the mean run-time is finite so long as the second moment\nof the service duration distribution is finite.\n"

Under suitable\nconditions, the solution of the stochastic differential equation can be reduced\nto the solution of an ordinary differential equation plus an application of\nGirsanov\'s theorem to adjust the drift. The discrete approximation is based on\na specific strong approximation of Brownian motion by simple, symmetric random\nwalks (the so-called "twist and shrink" method). A discrete It\\^o\'s formula is\nalso used during the discrete approximation.\n'

S'  We consider the problem of minimizing queue-length costs in a system with\nheterogenous parallel servers, operating in a many-server heavy-traffic regime\nwith nondegenerate slowdown. This regime is distinct from the well-studied\nheavy traffic diffusion regimes, namely the (single server) conventional regime\nand the (many-server) Halfin-Whitt regime. It has the distinguishing property\nthat waiting times and service times are of comparable magnitudes. We establish\nan asymptotic lower bound on the cost and devise a sequence of policies that\nasymptotically attain this bound. As in the conventional regime, the\nasymptotics can be described by means of a Brownian control problem, the\nsolution of which exhibits a state space collapse.\n'

S'  We study the convergence of a class of Runge-Kutta type schemes for backward\nstochastic differential equations (BSDEs) in a Markovian framework. The schemes\nbelonging to the class under consideration benefit from a certain stability\nproperty. As a consequence, the overall rate of the convergence of these\nschemes is controlled by their local truncation error. The schemes are\ncategorized by the number of intermediate stages implemented between\nconsecutive partition time instances. We show that the order of the schemes\nmatches the number $p$ of intermediate stages for $p\\le3$. Moreover, we show\nthat the so-called order barrier occurs at $p=3$, that is, that it is not\npossible to construct schemes of order $p$ with $p$ stages, when $p>3$. The\nanalysis is done under sufficient regularity on the final condition and on the\ncoefficients of the BSDE.\n'

S'  We generalise the construction of multivariate Hawkes processes to a possibly\ninfinite network of counting processes on a directed graph $\\mathbb G$. The\nprocess is constructed as the solution to a system of Poisson driven stochastic\ndifferential equations, for which we prove pathwise existence and uniqueness\nunder some reasonable conditions.\n  We next investigate how to approximate a standard $N$-dimensional Hawkes\nprocess by a simple inhomogeneous Poisson process in the mean-field framework\nwhere each pair of individuals interact in the same way, in the limit $N\n\\rightarrow \\infty$. In the so-called linear case for the interaction, we\nfurther investigate the large time behaviour of the process. We study in\nparticular the stability of the central limit theorem when exchanging the\nlimits $N, T\\rightarrow \\infty$ and exhibit different possible behaviours.\n  We finally consider the case $\\mathbb G = \\mathbb Z^d$ with nearest neighbour\ninteractions. In the linear case, we prove some (large time) laws of large\nnumbers and exhibit different behaviours, reminiscent of the infinite setting.\nFinally we study the propagation of a {\\it single impulsion} started at a given\npoint of $\\zz^d$ at time $0$. We compute the probability of extinction of such\nan impulsion and, in some particular cases, we can accurately describe how it\npropagates to the whole space.\n'

S'  A double-normal pair of a finite set $S$ of points from Euclidean space is a\npair of points $\\{p,q\\}$ from $S$ such that $S$ lies in the closed strip\nbounded by the hyperplanes through $p$ and $q$ that are perpendicular to $pq$.\nA double-normal pair $pq$ is strict if $S\\setminus\\{p,q\\}$ lies in the open\nstrip. We answer a question of Martini and Soltan (2006) by showing that a set\nof $n\\geq 3$ points in the plane has at most $3\\lfloor n/2\\rfloor$\ndouble-normal pairs. This bound is sharp for each $n\\geq 3$.\n  In a companion paper, we have asymptotically determined this maximum for\npoints in $R^3$. Here we show that if the set lies on some 2-sphere, it has at\nmost $17n/4 - 6$ double-normal pairs. This bound is attained for infinitely\nmany values of $n$.\n  We also establish tight bounds for the maximum number of strict double-normal\npairs in a set of $n$ points in the plane and on the sphere.\n'

This simplification leads to a\ndegenerate stochastic equation in the tangent bundle of the 2D sphere. Studying\nthis equation, we prove existence and non-uniqueness of invariant probability\nmeasures for the original problem and we obtain also results on attractivity\ntowards an invariant measure. We also present a suitable numerical scheme for\napproximating the solutions subject to a sphere constraint.\n'

Whether the central or the non-central limit theorem\napplies depends on the Hermite rank of the variation functional and on the\nsmallest component of the Hurst parameter vector of the fBs. The limiting\nprocess in the former result is another fBs, independent of the original fBs,\nwhereas the limit given by the latter result is an Hermite sheet, which is\ndriven by the same white noise as the original fBs.

In this case the form of the quasi-potential operators\n$B$ essentially differs from the form in the case of non-summable Levy\nmeasures.

S'  The theme of this paper is the analysis of bootstrap percolation processes on\nrandom graphs generated by preferential attachment. This is a class of\ninfection processes where vertices have two states: they are either infected or\nsusceptible. At each round every susceptible vertex which has at least $r\\geq\n2$ infected neighbours becomes infected and remains so forever. Assume that\ninitially $a(t)$ vertices are randomly infected, where $t$ is the total number\nof vertices of the graph. Suppose also that $r < m$, where $2m$ is the average\ndegree. We determine a critical function $a_c(t)$ such that when $a(t) \\gg\na_c(t)$, complete infection occurs with high probability as $t \\rightarrow\n\\infty$, but when $a(t) \\ll a_c (t)$, the process does not evolve. The critical\nfunction satisfies $a_c(t)=o(t)$. In other words, a sub-linear initial\ninfection leads to full infection. In contrast, when $r > m$, we show\ndeterministically that the final infected set has size at most $(m+1)a(t)$ and\nthe above phenomenon does not occur regardless of $a(t)$.\n'

S'  We use a simple N-player stochastic game with idiosyncratic and common noises\nto introduce the concept of Master Equation originally proposed by Lions in his\nlectures at the Coll\\`ege de France. Controlling the limit N tends to the\ninfinity of the explicit solution of the N-player game, we highlight the\nstochastic nature of the limit distributions of the states of the players due\nto the fact that the random environment does not average out in the limit, and\nwe recast the Mean Field Game (MFG) paradigm in a set of coupled Stochastic\nPartial Differential Equations (SPDEs). The first one is a forward stochastic\nKolmogorov equation giving the evolution of the conditional distributions of\nthe states of the players given the common noise. The second is a form of\nstochastic Hamilton Jacobi Bellman (HJB) equation providing the solution of the\noptimization problem when the flow of conditional distributions is given. Being\nhighly coupled, the system reads as an infinite dimensional Forward Backward\nStochastic Differential Equation (FBSDE). Uniqueness of a solution and its\nMarkov property lead to the representation of the solution of the backward\nequation (i.e. the value function of the stochastic HJB equation) as a\ndeterministic function of the solution of the forward Kolmogorov equation,\nfunction which is usually called the decoupling field of the FBSDE. The\n(infinite dimensional) PDE satisfied by this decoupling field is identified\nwith the \\textit{master equation}. We also show that this equation can be\nderived for other large populations equilibriums like those given by the\noptimal control of McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equations. The paper\nis written more in the style of a review than a technical paper, and we spend\nmore time and energy motivating and explaining the probabilistic interpretation\nof the Master Equation, than identifying the most general set of assumptions\nunder which our claims are true.\n'

The main difficulty of\nthis model is the lack of conserved quantities and the absence of an energy\nthat would decrease for any initial condition. We overcome this difficulty\nthanks to a functional which is decreasing in time in a neighborhood of any\nDirac mass (in the sense of the Wasserstein distance).

S'  Mean field games are studied in the framework of controlled martingale\nproblems, and general existence theorems are proven in which the equilibrium\ncontrol is Markovian. The framework is flexible enough to include degenerate\nvolatility, which may depend on both the control and the mean field. The\nobjectives need not be strictly convex, and the mean field interactions\nconsidered are nonlocal and Wasserstein-continuous. When the volatility is\nnondegenerate, the continuity assumptions may be weakened considerably. The\nproofs first use relaxed controls, which may be interpreted as mixed\nstrategies, to establish the existence of equilibria. Then, strict\n(non-relaxed) Markovian equilibria are constructed from relaxed equilibria by a\nmeasurable selection argument.\n'

S'  We start with an i.i.d.\\ sequence and consider the product of two\npolynomial-forms moving averages based on that sequence. The coefficients of\nthe polynomial forms are asymptotically slowly decaying homogeneous functions\nso that these processes have long memory. The product of these two polynomial\nforms is a stationary nonlinear process. We want to obtain limit theorems for\nthe normalized sums of this nonlinear process in two cases: exclusion of the\ndiagonal terms of the polynomial form, or inclusion. In either case, if the\nproduct has long memory, then the limits are given by a Wiener chaos, but these\nlimits are quite different. If the diagonals are excluded, then the limit is\nexpressed as in the product formula of two Wiener-It\\^o integrals. When the\ndiagonals are included, the limit stochastic integrals are typically due to a\nsingle factor of the product, namely the one with the strongest memory.\n'

S"  Biased random walks on supercritical Galton--Watson trees are introduced and\nstudied in depth by Lyons (1990) and Lyons, Pemantle and Peres (1996). We\ninvestigate the slow regime, in which case the walks are known to possess an\nexotic maximal displacement of order $(\\log n)^3$ in the first $n$ steps. Our\nmain result is another --- and in some sense even more --- exotic property of\nbiased walks: the maximal potential energy of the biased walks is of order\n$(\\log n)^2$. More precisely, we prove that, upon the system's non-extinction,\nthe ratio between the maximal potential energy and $(\\log n)^2$ converges\nalmost surely to $\\frac12$, when $n$ goes to infinity.\n"

This system can be used to model the transport of positive and\nnegative charges in a solar cell or the population dynamics of two segregated\nspecies under competition. A related interacting random walk model with\ndiscrete state spaces has recently been introduced and studied in [9]. In this\npaper, we establish the functional law of large numbers for this new system,\nthereby extending the hydrodynamic limit in [9] to reflected diffusions in\ndomains with mixed-type boundary conditions, which include absorption (harvest\nof electric charges). We employ a new and direct approach that avoids going\nthrough the delicate BBGKY hierarchy.\n'

S'  Critical points and singularities are encountered in the study of critical\nphenomena in probability and physics. We present recent results concerning the\nvalues of such critical points and the nature of the singularities for two\nprominent probabilistic models, namely percolation and the more general\nrandom-cluster model. The main topic is the statement and proof of the\ncriticality and universality of the canonical measure of bond percolation on\nisoradial graphs (due to the author and Ioan Manolescu). The key technique used\nin this work is the star--triangle transformation, known also as the\nYang--Baxter equation. The second topic reported here is the identification of\nthe critical point of the random-cluster model on the square lattice (due to\nBeffara and Duminil-Copin), and of the criticality of the canonical measure of\nthe random-cluster model with q \\ge 4 on periodic isoradial graphs (by the same\nauthors with Smirnov). The proof of universality for percolation is expected to\nextend to the random-cluster model on isoradial graphs.\n'

Based on a single observation of the path, we provide a maximum\nlikelihood estimation procedure of the parameters of the environment. Unlike\nmost of the classical maximum likelihood approach, the limit of the criterion\nfunction is in general a nondegenerate random variable and convergence does not\nhold in probability. Not only the leading term but also the second order\nasymptotics is needed to fully identify the unknown parameter. We present\ndifferent frameworks to illustrate these facts.

S'  We study Minkowski contents and fractal curvatures of arbitrary self-similar\ntilings (constructed on a feasible open set of an IFS) and the general\nrelations to the corresponding functionals for self-similar sets. In\nparticular, we characterize the situation, when these functionals coincide. In\nthis case, the Minkowski content and the fractal curvatures of a self-similar\nset can be expressed completely in terms of the volume function or curvature\ndata, respectively, of the generator of the tiling. In special cases such\nformulas have been obtained recently using tube formulas and complex dimensions\nor Perron-Frobenius theory. Our approach based on the classical Renewal Theorem\nis much simpler and works for a much larger class of self-similar sets and\ntilings. In fact, generator type formulas are obtained for essentially all\nself-similar sets, when suitable volume functions (or curvature functions,\nrespectively) related to the generator are used. We also strengthen known\nresults on the Minkowski measurability of self-similar sets, in particular on\nthe question of non-measurability in the lattice case.\n'

Informally,\nintegrable probabilistic systems have two properties: 1) It is possible to\nwrite down concise and exact formulas for expectations of a variety of\ninteresting observables (or functions) of the system. 2) Asymptotics of the\nsystem and associated exact formulas provide access to exact descriptions of\nthe properties and statistics of large universality classes and universal\nscaling limits for disordered systems. We focus here on examples of integrable\nprobabilistic systems related to the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality\nclass and explain how their integrability stems from connections with symmetric\nfunction theory and quantum integrable systems.\n'

S'  We provide a mathematical study of the modified Diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC)\nalgorithm introduced in the companion article \\cite{DMC}. DMC is a simulation\ntechnique that uses branching particle systems to represent expectations\nassociated with Feynman-Kac formulae. We provide a detailed heuristic\nexplanation of why, in cases in which a stochastic integral appears in the\nFeynman-Kac formula (e.g. in rare event simulation, continuous time filtering,\nand other settings), the new algorithm is expected to converge in a suitable\nsense to a limiting process as the time interval between branching steps goes\nto 0. The situation studied here stands in stark contrast to the "na\\"ive"\ngeneralisation of the DMC algorithm which would lead to an exponential\nexplosion of the number of particles, thus precluding the existence of any\nfinite limiting object. Convergence is shown rigorously in the simplest\npossible situation of a random walk, biased by a linear potential. The\nresulting limiting object, which we call the "Brownian fan", is a very natural\nnew mathematical object of independent interest.\n'

S'  We consider a large-scale flexible service system with two large server pools\nand two types of customers. Servers in pool 1 can only serve type 1 customers,\nwhile server in pool 2 are flexible -- they can serve both types 1 and 2. (This\nis a so-called "N-system." Our results hold for a more general class of systems\nas well.) The service rate of a customer depends both on its type and the pool\nwhere it is served. We study a priority service discipline, where type 2 has\npriority in pool 2, and type 1 prefers pool 1. We consider the Halfin-Whitt\nasymptotic regime, where the arrival rate of customers and the number of\nservers in each pool increase to infinity in proportion to a scaling parameter\n$n$, while the overall system capacity exceeds its load by $O(\\sqrt{n})$.\n  For this system we prove tightness of diffusion-scaled stationary\ndistributions. Our approach relies on a single common Lyapunov function $G(x)$,\ndefined on the entire state space as a functional of the {\\em drift-based fluid\nlimits} (DFL). Specifically, $G(x)=\\int_0^\\infty g(y(t)) dt$, where $y(\\cdot)$\nis the DFL starting at $x$, and $g(\\cdot)$ is a "distance" to the origin. The\nkey part of the analysis is the study of the (first and second) derivatives of\nthe DFLs and function $G(x)$. Our approach, as well as many parts of the\nanalysis, seem quite generic and may be of independent interest.\n'

The joint densities for\nthe complex eigenvalues of the product matrix can be written down exactly for a\nproduct of any fixed number of matrices and any finite matrix size. We show\nthat the squared absolute values of the eigenvalues form a permanental process,\ngeneralising the results of Kostlan and Rider for single matrices to products\nof complex and quaternionic matrices. Based on these findings, we can first\nwrite down exact results and asymptotic expansions for the so-called hole\nprobabilities, that a disc centered at the origin is void of eigenvalues.\nSecond, we compute the asymptotic expansion for the opposite problem, that a\nlarge fraction of complex eigenvalues occupies a disc of fixed radius centered\nat the origin; this is known as the overcrowding problem. While the expressions\nfor finite matrix size depend on the parameters of the induced ensembles, the\nasymptotic results agree to leading order with previous results for products of\nsquare Ginibre matrices.\n'

S'  In a call center, staffing decisions must be made before the call arrival\nrate is known with certainty. Then, once the arrival rate becomes known, the\ncall center may be over-staffed, in which case staff are being paid to be idle,\nor under-staffed, in which case many callers hang-up in the face of long wait\ntimes. Firms that have chosen to keep their call center operations in-house can\nmitigate this problem by co-sourcing; that is, by sometimes outsourcing calls.\nThen, the required staffing $N$ depends on how the firm chooses which calls to\noutsource in real-time, after the arrival rate realizes and the call center\noperates as a $M/M/N+M$ queue with an outsourcing option. Our objective is to\nfind a joint policy for staffing and call outsourcing that minimizes the long\nrun average cost of this two-stage stochastic program when there is a linear\nstaffing cost per unit time and linear costs associated with abandonments and\noutsourcing.\n  We propose a policy that uses a square-root safety staffing rule, and\noutsources calls in accordance with a threshold rule that characterizes when\nthe system is "too crowded". Analytically, we establish that our proposed\npolicy is asymptotically optimal, as the mean arrival rate becomes large, when\nthe level of uncertainty in the arrival rate is of the same order as the\ninherent system fluctuations in the number of waiting customers for a known\narrival rate. Through an extensive numerical study, we establish that our\npolicy is extremely robust. In particular, our policy performs remarkably well\nover a wide range of parameters, and far beyond where it is proved to be\nasymptotically optimal.\n'

S'  The $h$-trimming of a tree is a natural regularization procedure which\nconsists in pruning the small branches of a tree: given $h\\geq0$, it is\nobtained by only keeping the vertices having at least one leaf above them at a\ndistance greater or equal to $h$.\n  The $h$-cut of a function $f$ is the function of minimal total variation\nuniformly approximating the increments of $f$ with accuracy $h$, and can be\nexplicitly constructed via the two-sided Skorohod reflection of $f$ on the\ninterval $[0,h]$.\n  In this work, we show that the contour path of the $h$-trimming of a rooted\nreal tree is given by the $h$-cut of its original contour path. We provide two\napplications of this result. First, we recover a famous result of Neveu and\nPitman, which states that the $h$-trimming of a tree coded by a Brownian\nexcursion is distributed as a standard binary tree. In addition, we provide the\njoint distribution of this Brownian tree and its trimmed version in terms of\nthe local time of the two-sided reflection of its contour path. As a second\napplication, we relate the maximum of a sticky Brownian motion to the local\ntime of its driving process.\n'

We denote by $\\ell$ the length of the\nchromosomes, by $m$ the population size, by $p_C$ the crossover probability and\nby $p_M$ the mutation probability. We introduce a parameter $\\sigma$, called\nthe selection drift, which measures the selection intensity of the fittest\nchromosome. We show that the dynamics of the genetic algorithm depend in a\ncritical way on the parameter $$\\pi \\,=\\,\\sigma(1-p_C)(1-p_M)^\\ell\\,.$$ If\n$\\pi<1$, then the genetic algorithm operates in a disordered regime: an\nadvantageous mutant disappears with probability larger than $1-1/m^\\beta$,\nwhere $\\beta$ is a positive exponent. If $\\pi>1$, then the genetic algorithm\noperates in a quasispecies regime: an advantageous mutant invades a positive\nfraction of the population with probability larger than a constant $p^*$ (which\ndoes not depend on $m$). We estimate next the probability of the occurrence of\na catastrophe (the whole population falls below a fitness level which was\npreviously reached by a positive fraction of the population). The asymptotic\nresults suggest the following rules: $\\pi=\\sigma(1-p_C)(1-p_M)^\\ell$ should be\nslightly larger than $1$; $p_M$ should be of order $1/\\ell$; $m$ should be\nlarger than $\\ell\\ln\\ell$; the running time should be of exponential order in\n$m$. The first condition requires that $ \\ell p_M +p_C< \\ln\\sigma$. These\nconclusions must be taken with great care: they come from an asymptotic regime,\nand it is a formidable task to understand the relevance of this regime for a\nreal-world problem. At least, we hope that these conclusions provide\ninteresting guidelines for the practical implementation of the simple genetic\nalgorithm.\n'

The special form of the\ndrift (suggested by quantum mechanical considerations) gives, indeed, access to\nan algebrico-geometric method due, in essence, to E.Cartan, and called the\nMethod of Isovectors. A V singular at the origin, as well as a one-factor\naffine model relevant to stochastic finance, are considered as illustrations of\nthe method.\n"

S"  We consider loop-erased random walk (LERW) running between two boundary\npoints of a square grid approximation of a planar simply connected domain. The\nLERW Green's function is simply the probability that the LERW passes through a\ngiven edge in the domain. We prove that this probability, renormalized by a\npower of the mesh size, converges in the lattice size scaling limit to an\nexplicit conformally covariant quantity which coincides with the SLE(2) Green's\nfunction. The proof is based on a combinatorial identity which reduces the\nproblem to obtaining sharp asymptotics for two quantities: the loop measure of\nrandom walk loops of odd winding number about a branch point near the marked\nedge and a ``spinor'' observable for random walk started from one of the\nvertices of the marked edge.\n"

S'  We are interested in the clusters formed by a Poisson ensemble of Markovian\nloops on infinite graphs. This model was introduced and studied in [LeJ12] and\n[LL12]. It is a model with long range correlations with two parameters $\\alpha$\nand $\\kappa$. The non-negative parameter $\\alpha$ measures the amount of loops,\nand $\\kappa$ plays the role of killing on vertices penalizing ($\\kappa>0$) or\nfavoring ($\\kappa<0$) appearance of large loops. It was shown in [LL12] that\nfor any fixed $\\kappa$ and large enough $\\alpha$, there exists an infinite\ncluster in the loop percolation on $\\mathbb{Z}^d$. In the present article, we\nshow a non-trivial phase transition on the integer lattice $\\mathbb{Z}^d$\n($d\\geq 3$) for $\\kappa=0$. More precisely, we show that there is no loop\npercolation for $\\kappa=0$ and $\\alpha$ small enough. Interestingly, we observe\na critical like behavior on the whole sub-critical domain of $\\alpha$, namely,\nfor $\\kappa=0$ and any sub-critical value of $\\alpha$, the probability of\none-arm event decays at most polynomially. For $d\\geq 5$, we prove that there\nexists a non-trivial threshold for the finiteness of the expected cluster size.\nFor $\\alpha$ below this threshold, we calculate, up to a constant factor, the\ndecay of the probability of one-arm event, two point function, and the tail\ndistribution of the cluster size. These rates are comparable with the ones\nobtained from a single large loop and only depend on the dimension. For $d=3$\nor $4$, we give better lower bounds on the decay of the probability of one-arm\nevent, which show importance of small loops for long connections. In addition,\nwe show that the one-arm exponent in dimension $3$ depends on the intensity\n$\\alpha$. [LeJ12] Y. Le Jan, Amas de lacets markoviens, C. R. Math. Acad.

S'  We study a class of systems of stochastic differential equations describing\ndiffusive phenomena. The Smoluchowski-Kramers approximation is used to describe\ntheir dynamics in the small mass limit. Our systems have arbitrary\nstate-dependent friction and noise coefficients. We identify the limiting\nequation {and,} in particular, the additional drift term which appears in the\nlimit is expressed in terms of the solution to a Lyapunov matrix equation. The\nproof uses a theory of convergence of stochastic integrals developed by Kurtz\nand Protter. The result is sufficiently general to include systems driven by\nboth white and Ornstein-Uhlenbeck colored noises. We discuss applications of\nthe main theorem to several physical phenomena, including the experimental\nstudy of Brownian motion in a diffusion gradient.\n'

S"  Stricker's theorem states that a Gaussian process is a semimartingale in its\nnatural filtration if and only if it is the sum of an independent increment\nGaussian process and a Gaussian process of finite variation, see [1983, Z.\nWahrsch. Verw. Gebiete 64(3)]. We consider extensions of this result to non\nGaussian infinitely divisible processes. First we show that the class of\ninfinitely divisible semimartingales is so large that the natural analog of\nStricker's theorem fails to hold. Then, as the main result, we prove that an\ninfinitely divisible semimartingale relative to the filtration generated by a\nrandom measure admits a unique decomposition into an independent increment\nprocess and an infinitely divisible process of finite variation. Consequently,\nthe natural analog of Stricker's theorem holds for all strictly representable\nprocesses (as defined in this paper). Since Gaussian processes are strictly\nrepresentable due to Hida's multiplicity theorem, the classical Stricker's\ntheorem follows from our result. Another consequence is that the question when\nan infinitely divisible process is a semimartingale can often be reduced to a\npath property, when a certain associated infinitely divisible process is of\nfinite variation. Along these lines, using Basse-O'Connor and Rosi\\'nski [2013,\nStochastic Process. Appl. 123(6)], we characterize semimartingales within a\nlarge class of stationary increment infinitely divisible processes; this class\nincludes many infinitely divisible processes of interest, including linear\nfractional processes, mixed moving averages, and supOU processes, as particular\ncases. The proof of the main theorem relies on series representations of jumps\nof c\\`adl\\`ag infinitely divisible processes given in Basse-O'Connor and\nRosi\\'nski [2013, Ann. Probab. 41(6)] combined with techniques of stochastic\nanalysis.\n"

S'  We consider three one-dimensional continuous-time Markov processes on a\nlattice, each of which models the conduction of heat: the family of Brownian\nEnergy Processes with parameter $m$, a Generalized Brownian Energy Process, and\nthe Kipnis-Marchioro-Presutti process. The hydrodynamic limit of each of these\nthree processes is a parabolic equation, the linear heat equation in the case\nof the BEP$(m)$ and the KMP, and a nonlinear heat equation for the GBEP($a$).\nWe prove the hydrodynamic limit rigorously for the BEP$(m)$, and give a formal\nderivation for the GBEP($a$).\n  We then formally derive the pathwise large-deviation rate functional for the\nempirical measure of the three processes. These rate functionals imply\ngradient-flow structures for the limiting linear and nonlinear heat equations.\nWe contrast these gradient-flow structures with those for processes describing\nthe diffusion of mass, most importantly the class of Wasserstein gradient-flow\nsystems. The linear and nonlinear heat-equation gradient-flow structures are\neach driven by entropy terms of the form $-\\log \\rho$; they involve dissipation\nor mobility terms of order $\\rho^2$ for the linear heat equation, and a\nnonlinear function of $\\rho$ for the nonlinear heat equation.\n'

In this work we study the homotopy classes of bounded\ncurvature paths for generic points in the tangent bundle of the Euclidean\nplane. In particular, we characterize the behavior of homotopies of such paths\nin terms of boundedness or unboundedness of their path length. Moreover, for a\ntype of configuration of elements in the tangent bundle we prove the existence\nof a compact planar region in which no bounded curvature path lying on it can\nbe made homotopic to a path outside of the region. In particular, we establish\nthat for such type of configuration, the space of bounded curvature paths is\ndivided into two disjoint components.\n'

S'  This paper considers a classical question of approximation of Brownian motion\nby a random walk in the setting of a sub-Riemannian manifold $M$. To construct\nsuch a random walk we first address several issues related to the degeneracy of\nsuch a manifold. In particular, we define a family of sub-Laplacian operators\nnaturally connected to the geometry of the underlining manifold. In the case\nwhen $M$ is a Riemannian (non-degenerate) manifold, we recover the\nLaplace-Beltrami operator. We then construct the corresponding random walk, and\nunder standard assumptions on the sub-Laplacian and $M$ we show that this\nrandom walk weakly converges to a process, horizontal Brownian motion, whose\ninfinitesimal generator is the sub-Laplacian. An example of the Heisenberg\ngroup equipped with a standard sub-Riemannian metric is considered in detail,\nin which case the sub-Laplacian we introduced is shown to be the sum of squares\n(H\\"{o}rmander\'s) operator.\n'

S"  We develop connections between Stein's approximation method, logarithmic\nSobolev and transport inequalities by introducing a new class of functional\ninequalities involving the relative entropy, the Stein (factor or) matrix, the\nrelative Fisher information and the Wasserstein distance with respect to a\ngiven reference distribution on $\\mathbb{R}^d$. For the Gaussian model, the\nresults improve upon the classical logarithmic Sobolev inequality and the\nTalagrand quadratic transportation cost inequality. Further examples of\nillustrations include multidimensional gamma distributions, the uniform\ndistribution on a compact interval, as well as families of log-concave\ndensities. As a by-product, the new inequalities are relevant for entropic\nconvergence expressed in terms of the Stein matrix. The tools rely on semigroup\ninterpolation and bounds, in particular by means of the iterated gradients of\nthe Markov generator with invariant measure the distribution under\nconsideration. In a second part, motivated by the recent investigation by\nNourdin, Peccati and Swan on Wiener chaoses, we address the issue of entropic\nbounds on multidimensional functionals $F$ with the Stein matrix via a set of\ndata on $F$ and its gradients rather than on the Fisher information of the\ndensity. A natural framework for this investigation is given by the Markov\nTriple structure $(E, \\mu, \\Gamma)$ in which abstract Malliavin-type arguments\nmay be developed and extend the Wiener chaos setting.\n"

S'  The Internet heavily relies on Content Distribution Networks and transparent\ncaches to cope with the ever-increasing traffic demand of users. Content,\nhowever, is essentially versatile: once published at a given time, its\npopularity vanishes over time. All requests for a given document are then\nconcentrated between the publishing time and an effective perishing time.\n  In this paper, we propose a new model for the arrival of content requests,\nwhich takes into account the dynamical nature of the content catalog. Based on\ntwo large traffic traces collected on the Orange network, we use the\nsemi-experimental method and determine invariants of the content request\nprocess. This allows us to define a simple mathematical model for content\nrequests; by extending the so-called "Che approximation", we then compute the\nperformance of a LRU cache fed with such a request process, expressed by its\nhit ratio. We numerically validate the good accuracy of our model by comparison\nto trace-based simulation.\n'

S'  We consider the modified Monge-Kantorovich problem with additional\nrestriction: admissible transport plans must vanish on some fixed functional\nsubspace. Different choice of the subspace leads to different additional\nproperties optimal plans need to satisfy. Our main results are quite general\nand include several important examples. In particular, they include\nMonge-Kantorovich problems in the classes of invariant measures and\nmartingales. We formulate and prove a criterion for existence of a solution, a\nduality statement of the Kantorovich type, and a necessary geometric condition\non a support of optimal measure, which is analogues to the usual\n$c$-monotonicity.\n'

S"  The present paper introduces a jump-diffusion extension of the classical\ndiffusion default intensity model by means of subordination in the sense of\nBochner. We start from the bi-variate process $(X,D)$ of a diffusion state\nvariable $X$ driving default intensity and a default indicator process $D$ and\ntime change it with a L\\'{e}vy subordinator ${\\mathcal{T}}$. We characterize\nthe time-changed process\n$(X^{\\phi}_t,D^{\\phi}_t)=(X({\\mathcal{T}}_t),D({\\mathcal{T}}_t))$ as a\nMarkovian--It\\^{o} semimartingale and show from the Doob--Meyer decomposition\nof $D^{\\phi}$ that the default time in the time-changed model has a\njump-diffusion or a pure jump intensity. When $X$ is a CIR diffusion with\nmean-reverting drift, the default intensity of the subordinate model (SubCIR)\nis a jump-diffusion or a pure jump process with mean-reverting jumps in both\ndirections that stays nonnegative. The SubCIR default intensity model is\nanalytically tractable by means of explicitly computed eigenfunction expansions\nof relevant semigroups, yielding closed-form pricing of credit-sensitive\nsecurities.\n"

S"  We study the record statistics of random walks after $n$ steps, $x_0,\nx_1,\\ldots, x_n$, with arbitrary symmetric and continuous distribution\n$p(\\eta)$ of the jumps $\\eta_i = x_i - x_{i-1}$. We consider the age of the\nrecords, i.e. the time up to which a record survives. Depending on how the age\nof the current last record is defined, we propose three distinct sequences of\nages (indexed by $\\alpha$ = I, II, III) associated to a given sequence of\nrecords. We then focus on the longest lasting record, which is the longest\nelement among this sequence of ages. To characterize the statistics of these\nlongest lasting records, we compute: (i) the probability that the record of the\nlongest age is broken at step $n$, denoted by $Q^{\\alpha}(n)$, which we call\nthe probability of record breaking and: (ii) the duration of the longest\nlasting record, $\\ell_{\\max}^{\\alpha}(n)$. We show that both $Q^{\\alpha}(n)$\nand the full statistics of $\\ell_{\\max}^{\\alpha}(n)$ are universal, i.e.\nindependent of the jump distribution $p(\\eta)$. We compute exactly the large\n$n$ asymptotic behaviors of $Q^{\\alpha}(n)$ as well as $\\langle\n\\ell_{\\max}^{\\alpha}(n)\\rangle$ (when it exists) and show that each case gives\nrise to a different universal constant associated to random walks (including\nL\\'evy flights). While two of them appeared before in the excursion theory of\nBrownian motion, for which we provide here a simpler derivation, the third case\ngives rise to a non-trivial new constant $C^{\\rm III} = 0.241749 \\ldots$\nassociated to the records of random walks. Other observables characterizing the\nages of the records, exhibiting an interesting universal behavior, are also\ndiscussed.\n"

Start with a single vertex, and in each time-step\nchoose a uniformly random leaf and give it $d$ newly created offspring. Let\n${\\mathcal T}_t$ be the tree produced after $t$ steps. We show that there\nexists a fixed $\\delta<1$ depending on $d$ and $r$ such that almost surely for\nall large $t$, every $r$-ary subtree of ${\\mathcal T}_t$ has less than\n$t^{\\delta}$ vertices.\n  The proof involves analysis that also yields a related result. Consider the\nfollowing iterative construction of a random planar triangulation. Start with a\ntriangle embedded in the plane. In each step, choose a bounded face uniformly\nat random, add a vertex inside that face and join it to the vertices of the\nface. In this way, one face is destroyed and three new faces are created. After\n$t$ steps, we obtain a random triangulated plane graph with $t+3$ vertices,\nwhich is called a random Apollonian network. We prove that there exists a fixed\n$\\delta<1$, such that eventually every path in this graph has length less than\n$t^{\\delta}$, which verifies a conjecture of Cooper and Frieze.\n'

S'  The space of all normal currents with compact support in a metric space in\nthe sense of Ambrosio and Kirchheim becomes a chain complex. Its homology is\nproved to be naturally isomorphic to the measure homology of Thurston on the\ncategory of all weakly locally Lipschitz contractible metric spaces and all\nlocally Lipschitz maps. The class of weakly locally Lipschitz contractible\nmetric spaces is large, including all finite dimensional Alexandrov spaces of\ncurvature bounded locally from below or all locally CAT spaces.\n  To prove this result, a topology on a space of Lipschitz maps between\narbitrary metric spaces is introduced and its fundamental properties are\ninvestigated. Further, the $C^1$-topology on the space of all $C^1$-maps\nbetween Riemannian manifolds is characterized by our topology.\n'

The new model incorporates\npractical features from both the Omega risk model(Albrecher and Gerber and Shiu\n(2011)) and the risk model with tax(Albrecher and Hipp (2007)). We explicitly\ncharacterize the Laplace transform of the occupation time of an Azema-Yor\nprocess(e.g. a process refracted by functionals of its running maximum) below a\nconstant level until the first hitting time of another Azema-Yor process or\nuntil an independent exponential time. This result unifies and extends recent\nliterature(Li and Zhou (2013) and Zhang (2014)) incorporating some of their\nresults as special cases. We explicitly characterize the Laplace transform of\nthe time of bankruptcy in the Omega risk model with tax and discuss an\nextension to integral functionals.

S'  In this paper, we present an algorithm for the recovery of wireless networks\nafter a disaster. Considering a damaged wireless network, presenting coverage\nholes or/and many disconnected components, we propose a disaster recovery\nalgorithm which repairs the network. It provides the list of locations where to\nput new nodes in order to patch the coverage holes and mend the disconnected\ncomponents. In order to do this we first consider the simplicial complex\nrepresentation of the network, then the algorithm adds supplementary vertices\nin excessive number, and afterwards runs a reduction algorithm in order to\nreach an optimal result. One of the novelty of this work resides in the\nproposed method for the addition of vertices. We use a determinantal point\nprocess: the Ginibre point process which has inherent repulsion between\nvertices, and has never been simulated before for wireless networks\nrepresentation. We compare both the determinantal point process addition method\nwith other vertices addition methods, and the whole disaster recovery algorithm\nto the greedy algorithm for the set cover problem.\n'

S"  Switched queueing networks model wireless networks, input queued switches and\nnumerous other networked communications systems. For single-hop networks, we\nconsider a {($\\alpha,g$)-switch policy} which combines the MaxWeight policies\nwith bandwidth sharing networks -- a further well studied model of Internet\ncongestion. We prove the maximum stability property for this class of\nrandomized policies. Thus these policies have the same first order behavior as\nthe MaxWeight policies. However, for multihop networks some of these\ngeneralized polices address a number of critical weakness of the\nMaxWeight/BackPressure policies.\n  For multihop networks with fixed routing, we consider the Proportional\nScheduler (or (1,log)-policy). In this setting, the BackPressure policy is\nmaximum stable, but must maintain a queue for every route-destination, which\ntypically grows rapidly with a network's size. However, this proportionally\nfair policy only needs to maintain a queue for each outgoing link, which is\ntypically bounded in number. As is common with Internet routing, by maintaining\nper-link queueing each node only needs to know the next hop for each packet and\nnot its entire route. Further, in contrast to BackPressure, the Proportional\nScheduler does not compare downstream queue lengths to determine weights, only\nlocal link information is required. This leads to greater potential for\ndecomposed implementations of the policy. Through a reduction argument and an\nentropy argument, we demonstrate that, whilst maintaining substantially less\nqueueing overhead, the Proportional Scheduler achieves maximum throughput\nstability.\n"

S'  Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (CIR) processes are widely used in financial modeling such\nas in the Heston model for the approximative pricing of financial derivatives.\nMoreover, CIR processes are mathematically interesting due to the irregular\nsquare root function in the diffusion coefficient. In the literature, positive\nstrong convergence rates for numerical approximations of CIR processes have\nbeen established in the case of an inaccessible boundary point. Since\ncalibrations of the Heston model frequently result in parameters such that the\nboundary is accessible, we focus on this interesting case. Our main result\nshows for every $p \\in (0, \\infty)$ that the drift-implicit square-root Euler\napproximations proposed in Alfonsi (2005) converge in the strong $L^p$-distance\nwith a positive rate for half of the parameter regime in which the boundary\npoint is accessible. A key step in our proof is temporal regularity of Bessel\nprocesses. More precisely, we prove for every $p \\in (0, \\infty)$ that Bessel\nprocesses are temporally $1/2$-H\\"older continuous in $L^p$.\n'

S'  The Skorokhod reflection of a continuous semimartingale is unfolded, in a\npossibly skewed manner, into another continuous semimartingale on an enlarged\nprobability space according to the excursion-theoretic methodology of Prokaj\n(2009). This is done in terms of a skew version of the Tanaka equation, whose\nproperties are studied in some detail. The result is used to construct a system\nof two diffusive particles with rank-based characteristics and skew-elastic\ncollisions. Unfoldings of conventional reflections are also discussed, as are\nexamples involving skew Brownian Motions and skew Bessel processes.\n'

Here for bounded geometry we mean that $M$ have $Ricci$ curvature\nbounded below and volume of balls of radius $1$, uniformly bounded below with\nrespect to its centers. Then under an extra hypothesis on the geometry of $M$,\nwe apply this result to prove some differentiability property of $I_M$ and a\ndifferential inequality satisfied by $I_M$, extending in this way well known\nresults for compact manifolds, to this class of noncompact complete Riemannian\nmanifolds.\n'

S"  The new dual-pivot Quicksort by Vladimir Yaroslavskiy - used in Oracle's Java\nruntime library since version 7 - features intriguing asymmetries in its\nbehavior. They were shown to cause a basic variant of this algorithm to use\nless comparisons than classic single-pivot Quicksort implementations. In this\npaper, we extend the analysis to the case where the two pivots are chosen as\nfixed order statistics of a random sample and give the precise leading term of\nthe average number of comparisons, swaps and executed Java Bytecode\ninstructions. It turns out that - unlike for classic Quicksort, where it is\noptimal to choose the pivot as median of the sample - the asymmetries in\nYaroslavskiy's algorithm render pivots with a systematic skew more efficient\nthan the symmetric choice. Moreover, the optimal skew heavily depends on the\nemployed cost measure; most strikingly, abstract costs like the number of swaps\nand comparisons yield a very different result than counting Java Bytecode\ninstructions, which can be assumed most closely related to actual running time.\n"

In this case the limiting process is a convex combination of shifted\nintegrals of the intermittency function. Furthermore, we will demonstrate the\ncorresponding stable central limit theorem.

S'  A class of robust estimators of scatter applied to information-plus-impulsive\nnoise samples is studied, where the sample information matrix is assumed of low\nrank; this generalizes the study of (Couillet et al., 2013b) to spiked random\nmatrix models. It is precisely shown that, as opposed to sample covariance\nmatrices which may have asymptotically unbounded (eigen-)spectrum due to the\nsample impulsiveness, the robust estimator of scatter has bounded spectrum and\nmay contain isolated eigenvalues which we fully characterize. We show that, if\nfound beyond a certain detectability threshold, these eigenvalues allow one to\nperform statistical inference on the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the\ninformation matrix. We use this result to derive new eigenvalue and eigenvector\nestimation procedures, which we apply in practice to the popular array\nprocessing problem of angle of arrival estimation. This gives birth to an\nimproved algorithm based on the MUSIC method, which we refer to as robust\nG-MUSIC.\n'

S'  We study a geometric bootstrap percolation model, line percolation, on the\nd-dimensional grid [n]^d. In line percolation with infection parameter r,\ninfection spreads from a subset A of initially infected lattice points as\nfollows: if there is an axis parallel line L with r or more infected lattice\npoints on it, then every lattice point of [n]^d on L gets infected and we\nrepeat this until the infection can no longer spread. The elements of the set A\nare usually chosen independently, with some density p, and the main question is\nto determine p_c(n,r,d), the critical density at which percolation (infection\nof the entire grid) becomes likely. In this paper, we determine p_c(n,r,2) up\nto a factor of 1+o(1) and p_c(n,r,3) up to multiplicative constants as n tends\nto infinity for every fixed natural number r. We also determine the size of the\nminimal percolating sets in all dimensions and for all values of the infection\nparameter.\n'

A number of mentions was maid with respect to various inconsistencies\nand faulty statements omnipresent in the literature devoted to so-called\nfractional quantum mechanics spectral problems. Presently, we give a decisive\ncomputer-assisted proof, for an exemplary finite and ultimately infinite Cauchy\nwell problem, that spectral solutions proposed so far were plainly wrong. As a\nconstructive input, we provide an explicit spectral solution of the finite\nCauchy well. The infinite well emerges as a limiting case in a sequence of\ndeepening finite wells. The employed numerical methodology (algorithm based on\nthe Strang splitting method) has been tested for an exemplary Cauchy oscillator\nproblem, whose analytic solution is available. An impact of the inherent\nspatial nonlocality of motion generators upon computer-assisted outcomes\n(potentially defective, in view of various cutoffs), i.e. detailed eigenvalues\nand shapes of eigenfunctions, has been analyzed.\n'

The main condition\nimposed, in order to avoid arbitrage opportunities, is a local continuity\nrequirement on the final portfolio value considered as a functional on the\ntrajectory space. The paper shows this to be a natural requirement by proving\nthat a large class of practical trading strategies, defi?ned by means of\ntrajectory based stopping times, give rise to locally continuous functionals.\nThe theory is illustrated, with some detail, for two specific trajectory models\nof practical interest. The implications for stochastic models which are not\nsemimartingales are described. The present paper extends some of the results in\n[1] by incorporating in the formalism a larger set of trading portfolios.\n'

Our approach is not\nbased on a approach via geometric sums, like most of the results on the\nbehaviour of $\\mathbf P (M^{(a)}>x)$ are. Instead we use martingale arguments\nand inequalities.\n'

S'  For H\\"older continuous functions $W(t,x)$ and $\\phi_t$, we define nonlinear\nintegral $\\int_a^b W(dt, \\phi_t)$ in various senses, including It\\^o-Skorohod\nand pathwise. We study their properties and relations. The stochastic flow in a\ntime dependent rough vector field associated with $\\dot \\phi_t=(\\partial\n_tW)(t, \\phi_t)$ is also studied and its applications to the transport equation\n$\\partial _t u(t,x)-\\partial _t W(t,x)\\nabla u(t,x)=0$ in rough media is given.\nThe Feynman-Kac solution to the stochastic partial differential equation with\nrandom coefficients $\\partial _t u(t,x)+Lu(t,x) +u(t,x)W(t,x)=0$ are given,\nwhere $L$ is a second order elliptic differential operator with random\ncoefficients (dependent on $W$). To establish such formula the main difficulty\nis the exponential integrability of some nonlinear integrals, which is proved\nto be true under some mild conditions on the covariance of $W$. Along the way,\nwe also obtain an upper bound for increments of stochastic processes on\nmultidimensional rectangles by majorizing measures.\n'

S'  Consider a family of $\\Delta$-latticed aperiodic random walks $\\{S^{(a)},0\\le\na\\le a_0\\}$ with increments $X_i^{(a)}$ and non-positive drift $-a$.

In this paper we provide the asymptotics of\n$\\mathbf{P}(M^{(a)}=y\\Delta)$ as $a\\to 0$ in the case, when $y\\to \\infty$ and\n$ay=O(1)$. This asymptotics follows from a representation of\n$\\mathbf{P}(M^{(a)}=y\\Delta)$ via a geometric sum and a uniform renewal\ntheorem, which is also proved in this paper.\n'

S"  Freedman's inequality is a martingale counterpart to Bernstein's inequality.\nThis result shows that the tail probability of a martingale is controlled by\nthe quadratic characteristic and a uniform upper bound for the martingale\ndifference sequence. Replacing the quadratic characteristic with\n$\\textrm{H}_k^y:= \\sum_{i=1}^k\\left(\\mathbf{E}(\\xi_i^2 |\\mathcal{F}_{i-1})\n+\\xi_i^2\\textbf{1}_{\\{|\\xi_i|> y\\}}\\right),$ Dzhaparidze and van Zanten\n(\\emph{Stochastic Process.

S'  We generalise the coarse Ricci curvature method of Ollivier by considering\nthe coarse Ricci curvature of multiple steps in the Markov chain. This implies\nnew spectral bounds and concentration inequalities. We also extend this\napproach to the bounds for MCMC empirical averages obtained by Joulin and\nOllivier. We prove a recursive lower bound on the coarse Ricci curvature of\nmultiple steps in the Markov chain, making our method broadly applicable.\nApplications include the split-merge random walk on partitions, Glauber\ndynamics with random scan and systemic scan for statistical physical spin\nmodels, and random walk on a binary cube with a forbidden region.\n'

S'  A linear stochastic vector advection equation is considered; the equation may\nmodel a passive magnetic field in a random fluid. When the driving velocity\nfield is rough but deterministic, in particular just H\\"{o}lder continuous and\nbounded, one can construct examples of infinite stretching of the passive\nfield, arising from smooth initial conditions. The purpose of the paper is to\nprove that infinite stretching is prevented if the driving velocity field\ncontains in addition a white noise component.\n'

We discuss some asymmetric versions of the\ncontinuous-time GARCH model, concentrating then on the GJR-COGARCH. We\ncalculate higher order moments and extend the first jump approximation. These\nresults are prerequisites for moment estimation and pseudo maximum likelihood\nestimation of the GJR-COGARCH parameters, respectively, which we derive in\ndetail.\n'

S'  We introduce and study a new model that we call the {\\em matching model}.\nItems arrive one by one in a buffer and depart from it as soon as possible but\nby pairs. The items of a departing pair are said to be {\\em matched}. There is\na finite set of classes $\\maV$ for the items, and the allowed matchings depend\non the classes, according to a {\\em matching graph} on $\\maV$. Upon arrival, an\nitem may find several possible matches in the buffer. This indeterminacy is\nresolved by a {\\em matching policy}. When the sequence of classes of the\narriving items is i.i.d., the sequence of buffer-contents is a Markov chain,\nwhose stability is investigated. In particular, we prove that the model may be\nstable if and only if the matching graph is non-bipartite.\n'

In \\cite{LM_compressed}, it was\nshown that $N$ independent copies of $X$ can be used as measurement vectors in\nCompressed Sensing (using the basis pursuit algorithm) to reconstruct any\n$d$-sparse vector with the optimal number of measurements $N\\gtrsim d\n\\log\\big(e n/d\\big)$.

This exhibits the fact that the convex relaxation\nof $\\ell_0$-minimization comes at a significant cost when using `spiky'\nmeasurement vectors.\n"
